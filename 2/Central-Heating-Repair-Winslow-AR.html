<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
