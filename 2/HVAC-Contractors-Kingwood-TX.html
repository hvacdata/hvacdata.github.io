<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, cruel summertime.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
