<p>The EPA and CMHC scientists used various approaches. The CMHC study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not control for time invested or approaches used. The EPA study prescribed and controlled techniques used on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and approaches used by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed since these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same method as a car radiator or typical family air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
