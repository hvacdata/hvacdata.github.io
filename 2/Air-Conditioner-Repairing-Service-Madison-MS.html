<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Madison MS</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
