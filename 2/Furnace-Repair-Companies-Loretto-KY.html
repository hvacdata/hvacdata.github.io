<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time.
