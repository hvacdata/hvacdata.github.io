When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to set up.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.
