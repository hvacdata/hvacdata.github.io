<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
