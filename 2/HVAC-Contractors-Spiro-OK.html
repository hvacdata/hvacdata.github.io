<h3>AC Service in Spiro OK</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
