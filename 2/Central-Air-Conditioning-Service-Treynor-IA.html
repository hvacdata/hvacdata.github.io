<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
