<p>I am an investor, I need to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants basically continually. Other sources, related to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies launch pollutants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented devices or incorrectly utilized products can release greater and sometimes dangerous levels of contaminants indoors.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
