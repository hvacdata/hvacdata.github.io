As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Many well and city water does not generally contain lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead materials.
