<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Lynch Station</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being typical features of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green building movement. Green jobs represented 20 percent of all newly constructed homes in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article predicted that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the entire real estate market.<p>
