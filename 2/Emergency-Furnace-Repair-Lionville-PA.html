<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
