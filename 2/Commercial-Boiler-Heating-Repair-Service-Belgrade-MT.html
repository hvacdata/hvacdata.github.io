<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
