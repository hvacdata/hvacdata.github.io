<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
