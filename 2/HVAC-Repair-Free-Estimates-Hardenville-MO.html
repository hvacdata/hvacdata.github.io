Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
