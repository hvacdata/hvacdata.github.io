Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
