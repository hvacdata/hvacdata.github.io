<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
