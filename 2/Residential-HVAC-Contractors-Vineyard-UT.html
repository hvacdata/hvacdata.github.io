<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher frequency of resident respiratory issues.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
