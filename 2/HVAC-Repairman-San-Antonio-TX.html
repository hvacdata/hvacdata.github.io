<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
