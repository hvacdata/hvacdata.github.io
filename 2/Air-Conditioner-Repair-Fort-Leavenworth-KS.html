<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
