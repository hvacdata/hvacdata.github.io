<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
