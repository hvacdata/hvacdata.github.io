Combustion items from vehicle exhaust, heaters, water heaters, space heating units, aromatic candle lights, oil lamps, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion items might lead to throat, nose, and eye irritation; fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>A geothermal heatpump is also a very safe heating and cooling solution, due to the fact that it does not require any kind of combustion, unlike alternatives.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, human beings exhale carbon dioxide, which in small quantities is not poisonous, but might become harmful if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or germs might likewise be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the entire work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
