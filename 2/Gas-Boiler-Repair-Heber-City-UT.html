<p>In general, ductless AC units are more energy-efficient and eco-friendly than traditional HVACs. This is due to the fact that you can switch off specific spaces when you're not inhabiting them. On top of that, ductless ACs can raise and reduce their temperature level easily, saving you energy and cash that regular HVAC compressors will waste by continuously launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an a/c unit to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioner: Do not position it in an egress window that serves as the only means of escape need to a fire erupt.<p>
