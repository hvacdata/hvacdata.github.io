<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
