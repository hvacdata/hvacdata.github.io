<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
