<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a property owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>

<p>Depending on where in the United States your house is located, the local region's climate can change drastically.
