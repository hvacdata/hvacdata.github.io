<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
