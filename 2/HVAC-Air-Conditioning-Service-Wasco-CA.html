Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
