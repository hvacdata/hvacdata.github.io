In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
