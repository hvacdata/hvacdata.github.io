Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
