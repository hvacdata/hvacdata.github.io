If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may become really unclean. These aspects of the devices are essential for efficient air conditioning.
