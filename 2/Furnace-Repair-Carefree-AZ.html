<p>Check these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
