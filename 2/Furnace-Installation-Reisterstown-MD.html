<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
