<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
