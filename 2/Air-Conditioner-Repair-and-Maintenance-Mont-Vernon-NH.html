<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Mont Vernon New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
