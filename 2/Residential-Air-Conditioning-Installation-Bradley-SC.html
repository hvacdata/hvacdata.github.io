<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
