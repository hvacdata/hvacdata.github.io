<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri.

<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air.
