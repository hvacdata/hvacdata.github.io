<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time.

I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
