<p>A routine furnace tune up can optimize performance and provide longer lasting house heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can identify a problem that will need a considerable financial investment to correct. Then, it's choice time. Do you make the costly repair and delight in ongoing convenience from your existing heating system? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to changing the furnace?

<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Redlands California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE scores frequently feature greater price tags. So, make sure to decide based on how often you will use your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For many temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having an incredibly high rated heating unit is not always required.<p>
