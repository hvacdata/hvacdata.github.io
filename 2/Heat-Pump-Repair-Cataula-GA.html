<h3>Heating Duct in Cataula Georgia</h3>
<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.
