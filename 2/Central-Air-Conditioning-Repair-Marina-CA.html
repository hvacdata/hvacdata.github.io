<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
