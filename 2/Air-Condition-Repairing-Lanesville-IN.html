<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
