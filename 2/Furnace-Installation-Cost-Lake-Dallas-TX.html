<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence.

(Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
