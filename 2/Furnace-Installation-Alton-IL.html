<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these contaminants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent room home furnishings that accumulate dust, especially if they can not be washed in hot water. Because vacuuming can really increase air-borne levels of mite irritants and other biological contaminants, allergic individuals must also leave the house while it is being vacuumed. Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also be of help.<p>
<p>HVAC coils normally offer you an excellent 15-20 years of life prior to they begin developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only problem a/c coils have.
