<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern.

<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
