<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>I highly recommend using this service. Very reliable extremely great. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quickly and effective and did not have to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Excellent company begun by a guy who is wanting to grow his service and secure his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Great unit and a very good rate. I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it two times a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
