<p>Immediate results might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your home is located, the local region's climate can change considerably. A home located in the South would require an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers.
