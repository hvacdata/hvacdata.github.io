<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Boggstown IN</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
