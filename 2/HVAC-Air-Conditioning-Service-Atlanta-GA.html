And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
