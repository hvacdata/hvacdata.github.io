According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
