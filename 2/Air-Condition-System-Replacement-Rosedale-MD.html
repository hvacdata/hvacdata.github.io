<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
