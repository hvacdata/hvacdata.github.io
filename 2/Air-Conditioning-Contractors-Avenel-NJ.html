<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for dispersing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfortable climate in every space. However ducts that are not installed effectively or kept can distribute pollutants from one room to another.
