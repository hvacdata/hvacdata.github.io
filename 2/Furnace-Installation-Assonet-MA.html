Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
