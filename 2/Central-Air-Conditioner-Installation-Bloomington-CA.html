<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
