Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
