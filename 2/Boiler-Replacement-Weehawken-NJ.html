<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
