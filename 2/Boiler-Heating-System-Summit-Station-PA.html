<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
