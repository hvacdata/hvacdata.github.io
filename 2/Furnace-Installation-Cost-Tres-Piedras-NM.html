<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers should attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
