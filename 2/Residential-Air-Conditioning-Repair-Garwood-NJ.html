Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad.
