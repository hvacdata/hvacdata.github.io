<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>A radiator is the part of your car that keeps the engine cool and safeguards it from extreme heating. To be cool, the radiator needs to stay clean - constantly. With time, sludge, rust and other solid deposits build up inside your automobile's radiator. These make the cooling system become stopped up and less reliable. This in effect hurts your automobile's efficiency. A routine radiator flush suffices to keep the system in shape. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your routine automobile maintenance schedule. For all your radiator flush requirements, call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>

<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in describing what services would be carried out.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar producers might decline service warranty coverage.<p>
