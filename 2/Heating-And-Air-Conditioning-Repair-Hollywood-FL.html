<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air.

Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
