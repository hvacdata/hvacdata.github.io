<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
