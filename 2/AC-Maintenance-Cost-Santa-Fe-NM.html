<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they do not need any new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
