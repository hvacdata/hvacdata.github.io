<h3>Furnace Installation Near me in Dearborn Heights MI</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents might be exposed to a range of impurities (in the kind of gases and particles) from office devices, cleaning items, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
