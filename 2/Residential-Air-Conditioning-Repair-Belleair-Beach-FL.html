That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
