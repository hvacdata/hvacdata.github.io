<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to provide threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
