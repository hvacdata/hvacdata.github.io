<p>We look at clues before we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
