<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative effect on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
