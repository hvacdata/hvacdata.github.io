<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
