<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
