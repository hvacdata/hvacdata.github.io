<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
