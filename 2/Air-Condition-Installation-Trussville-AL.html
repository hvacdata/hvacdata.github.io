<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The main factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered.

However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
