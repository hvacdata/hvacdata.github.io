<p>There are numerous reasons why this can happen. The bright side is that you can attend to a lot of these factors on your own without the requirement to require expert assistance. Start by opening the heat registers and then proceed to checking the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover. You can also examine the filter to ensure it is clear of dirt and check the standing pilot light to make sure it is lit.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
