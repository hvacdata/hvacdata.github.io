Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not just the condition of your existing devices, however likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
