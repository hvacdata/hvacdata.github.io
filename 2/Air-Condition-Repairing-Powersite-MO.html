<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (expressed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less efficient collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less efficient.

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most cost-effective option.<p>

<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
