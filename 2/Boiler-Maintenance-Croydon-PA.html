<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
