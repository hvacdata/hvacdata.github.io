<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
