When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
