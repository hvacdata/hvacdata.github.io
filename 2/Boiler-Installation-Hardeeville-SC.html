<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
