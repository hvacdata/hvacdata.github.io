HVAC experts advise following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
