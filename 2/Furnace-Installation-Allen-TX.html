<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to keep an eye out for is the dust that gathers during summers. The best thing to do is making certain that the heater burners are checked and cleaned up completely before colder seasons begin. Always be sure that the furnace is cleaned up each year to avoid soot and condensation which triggers burners to stop working correctly. Perhaps it is time to start believing about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
