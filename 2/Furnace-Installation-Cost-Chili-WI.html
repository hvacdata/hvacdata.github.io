<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competitors for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average wages for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 per year.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially directions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
