<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Due to the fact that they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
