<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
