<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
