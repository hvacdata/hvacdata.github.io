He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. Moreover, the concrete outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely advantageous result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
