<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
