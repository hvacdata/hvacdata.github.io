<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
