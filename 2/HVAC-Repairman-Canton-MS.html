<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<h3>How To Get Rid of Boiler Issues in Canton MS</h3>
<p>Even newer heating systems less than five years of ages have actually been discovered as bad. Too many homeowners are stunned to find out that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and then switch it ON.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
