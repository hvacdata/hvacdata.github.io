<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, merely adding refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician needs to fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and performance of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heater) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.
