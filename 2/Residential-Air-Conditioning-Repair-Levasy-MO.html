<h3>Boiler Installation in Levasy Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.
