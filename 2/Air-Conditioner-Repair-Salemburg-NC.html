<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Salemburg NC</h3>
<p>Most people do not know how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining correctly, you'll have a water leakage. A restriction in your drain pipes causes a water leak. There are various places an obstruction can occur. Among the primary areas where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
