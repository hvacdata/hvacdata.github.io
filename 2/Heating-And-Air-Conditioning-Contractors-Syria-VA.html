<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.

Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
