<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>
