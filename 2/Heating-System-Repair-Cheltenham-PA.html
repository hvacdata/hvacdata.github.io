According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
