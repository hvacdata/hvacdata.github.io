He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
