It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
