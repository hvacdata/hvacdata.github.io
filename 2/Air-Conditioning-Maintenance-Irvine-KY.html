<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries.
