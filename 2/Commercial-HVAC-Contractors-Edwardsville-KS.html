<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office devices; furnishings, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is necessary to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should.

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping an eye on data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
