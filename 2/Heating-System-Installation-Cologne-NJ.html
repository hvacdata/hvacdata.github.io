A house heated by a glowing system will warm up faster, and remain warm with less energy invested. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can use you.<p>

According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>

This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
