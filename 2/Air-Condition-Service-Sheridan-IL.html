<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
