<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
