<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Every personal residence and small business requires the services of competent technicians trained in the installation, maintenance, and repair of a/c, refrigeration, and heating systems. The Residential HVAC Service Technician certificate opens numerous doors of opportunity for HGTC graduates. The self-motivated graduate from this program has the technical training to work as an installation specialist, service technician, service manager, or sales agent anywhere in the country. This program is authorized by the local HVAC market through a program advisory committee.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
