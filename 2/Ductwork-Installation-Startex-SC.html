<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Startex SC</h3>
<p>Having a wood-burning heating unit can be very effective in terms of cost. If you have access to free or cheap firewood, or you cut your own wood from your woodlot, it may not cost you anything at all. Unfortunately, wood-burning heating systems need a really essential natural deposit: wood! Since of the quantity of wood needed to appropriately heat your whole house, wood-burning heat systems may not be excellent for the environment in spite of being carbon neutral.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
