<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This allows items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants and even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's important that it's sized correctly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be heated effectively and the system will need to continuously run to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the general indoor air quality meets a particular requirement. Occupational exposure limits listed in health and wellness regulations and the Threshold Limit Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or certain results (like eye and nose inflammation) in commercial circumstances. These limits might not be proper in office settings or for the house.<p>
