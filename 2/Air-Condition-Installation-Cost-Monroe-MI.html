<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, identifying the proper size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
