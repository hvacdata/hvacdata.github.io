PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space a/c provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
