<p>When all the tasks have been completed, the last task is to test the system to make certain it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as simple as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to turn on may just involve a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>
