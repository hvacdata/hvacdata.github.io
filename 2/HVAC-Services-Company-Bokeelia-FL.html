Some results may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent indoors.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
