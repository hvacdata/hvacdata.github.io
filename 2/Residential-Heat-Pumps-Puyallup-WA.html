That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
