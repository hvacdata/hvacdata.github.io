<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
