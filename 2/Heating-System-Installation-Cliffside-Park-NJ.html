<p>PE companies tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big company in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.
