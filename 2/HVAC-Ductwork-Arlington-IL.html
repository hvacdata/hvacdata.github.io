<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
