<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
