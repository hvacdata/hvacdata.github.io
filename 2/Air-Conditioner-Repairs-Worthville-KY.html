But the chances are good that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

<p>Equipment costs are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heating system. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however result in greater energy bills. High-efficiency designs cost more, however save more over the long run. Costs for gas heating systems vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces start at $395 and vary as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand name and furnace size.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of electric radiant floor heating system, all are factory-built to stay in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any interference or disruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system unusable. This is among the disadvantages to installing an electric convected heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and appropriately taken care of, the possibility of them having problems is little.<p>
