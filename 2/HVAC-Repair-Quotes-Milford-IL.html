<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
