<p>I normally don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
