<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
