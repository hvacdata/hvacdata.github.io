<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Lagrange IN</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
