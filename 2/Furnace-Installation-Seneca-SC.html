<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, because it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.
