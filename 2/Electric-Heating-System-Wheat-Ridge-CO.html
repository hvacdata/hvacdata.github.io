<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
