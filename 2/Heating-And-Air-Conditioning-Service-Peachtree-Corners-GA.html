<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
