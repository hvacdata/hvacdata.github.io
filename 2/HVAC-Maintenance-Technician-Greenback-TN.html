These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow.

The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
