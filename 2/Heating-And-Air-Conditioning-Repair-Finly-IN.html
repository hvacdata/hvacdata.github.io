During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
