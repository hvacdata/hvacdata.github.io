<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Orem UT</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
