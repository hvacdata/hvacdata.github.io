Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
