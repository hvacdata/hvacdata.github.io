<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your home might not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find odors in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
