His time and proficiency to SOLVE the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
