<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
