Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it ends up being wet.<p>
