<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, specifically in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, certain fuels and equipment might need special licenses, and there is limited flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise using our insulation boards. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money.
