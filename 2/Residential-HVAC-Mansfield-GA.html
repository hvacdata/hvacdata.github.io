<h3>Facts All Mansfield GA Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit.

<h3>Home Furnace in Mansfield GA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the system can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
