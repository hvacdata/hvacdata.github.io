<h3>AC Repair Cost in Furlong Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages.
