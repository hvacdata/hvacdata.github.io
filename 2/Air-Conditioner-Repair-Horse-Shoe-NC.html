<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential portion of your cooling is the outdoor system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage during the winter.

Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the exterior of the system and ensure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or excessive wear to the exterior. They might recommend that you trim back overgrown trees or bushes to make sure sufficient airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
