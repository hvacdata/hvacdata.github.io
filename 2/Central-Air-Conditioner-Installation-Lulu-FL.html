<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outside air that need to be continuously supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be useful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
