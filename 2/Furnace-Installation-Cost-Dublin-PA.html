<p>IÃ¢ $ m really picky with my stuff. I like my devices and devices initial, I wonÃ¢ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So buying this air conditioning system to change my old one was rather of a challenging reality. You canÃ¢ $ t trust the commercial these days. Since it has restored my faith in great manufacturing, am grateful I got this though. I havenÃ¢ $ t had a problem with this new Provider I got considering that I bought it 7 months back.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
