<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might become clogged, lowering air flow circulation, volume, and quality. They also might become locations for germs and molds to be and grow dispersed throughout the house.

Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
