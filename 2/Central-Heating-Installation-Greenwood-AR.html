<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
