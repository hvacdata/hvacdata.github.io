<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
