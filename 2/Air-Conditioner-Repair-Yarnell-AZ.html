<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors remove pollutants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
