<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
