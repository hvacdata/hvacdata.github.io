Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
