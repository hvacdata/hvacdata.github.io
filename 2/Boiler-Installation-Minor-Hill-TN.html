<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor.

Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
