<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
