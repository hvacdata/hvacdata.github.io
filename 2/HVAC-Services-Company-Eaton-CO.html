<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to buy what was left of the company in 2013, he took it.<p>
