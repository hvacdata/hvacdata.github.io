<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
