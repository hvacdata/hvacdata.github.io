<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has shown that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the largest and most industrialized cities.

<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
