<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
