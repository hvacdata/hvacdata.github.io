<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Environment Pro is dependable and genuinely appreciated us and our circumstance. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he might look for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
