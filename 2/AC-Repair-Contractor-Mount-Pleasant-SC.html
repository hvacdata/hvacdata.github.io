<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Mount Pleasant South Carolina</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use.
