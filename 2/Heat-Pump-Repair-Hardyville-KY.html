<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
