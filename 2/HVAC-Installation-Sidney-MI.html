<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead goes into the body. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>

Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this.
