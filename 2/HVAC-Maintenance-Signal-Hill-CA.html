It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
