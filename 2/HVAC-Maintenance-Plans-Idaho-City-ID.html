<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
