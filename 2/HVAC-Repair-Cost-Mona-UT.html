<p>Healthcare facility running theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to decrease infection threat and the humidity managed to limit patient dehydration.

<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

<p>In addition to getting the huge photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring devices to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
