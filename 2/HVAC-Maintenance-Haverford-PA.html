<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
