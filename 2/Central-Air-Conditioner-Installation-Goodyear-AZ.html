For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line?
