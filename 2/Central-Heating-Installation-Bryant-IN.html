<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
