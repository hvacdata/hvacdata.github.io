<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
