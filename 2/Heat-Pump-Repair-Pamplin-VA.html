Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors.<p>
