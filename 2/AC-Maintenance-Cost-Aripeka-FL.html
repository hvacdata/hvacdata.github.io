<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
