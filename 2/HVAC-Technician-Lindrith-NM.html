The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year.

<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.
