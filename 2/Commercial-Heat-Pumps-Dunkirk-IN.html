<p>Many individuals ignore the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is normally imagined as the black smoke produced from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, paints, and cleaners used in the home. To compound the issue, it is estimated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and majority that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Brands carried: When seeking estimates for new or replacement heating or cooling devices make sure to ask potential companies what specific makers or equipment brand names they bring. Unlike other home enhancement contractors, HVAC companies often just carry a little choice of brands. You may need to limit your hiring options to companies that specialize in your equipment brand of option if you're doing your own rate comparison research on brand-new devices.<p>
<p>Prior to installing any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is needed to re evaluate and minimize the energy load of the home.

Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend numerous certified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
