<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Piper City IL</h3>
<p>Spot Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans need to be installed in all kitchens and restrooms. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most effective fans are quiet and resilient. Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to ensure the fans run for an adequate period of time. An excellent rule of thumb is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
