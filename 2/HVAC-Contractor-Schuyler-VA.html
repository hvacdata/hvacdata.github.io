<p>Sean was very useful. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
