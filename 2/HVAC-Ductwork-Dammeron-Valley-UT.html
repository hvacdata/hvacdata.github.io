<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality.
