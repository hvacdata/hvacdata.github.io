<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, human beings breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not poisonous, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are enabled to collect. Germs or micro-organisms might also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
