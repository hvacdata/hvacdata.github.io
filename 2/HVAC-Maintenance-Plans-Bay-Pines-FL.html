<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
