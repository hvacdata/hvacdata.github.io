<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Palo Verde Arizona</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>As with houses, the most important factor affecting indoor air quality is the existence of pollutant sources. Frequently discovered office contaminants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building materials; formaldehyde from pressed wood items; other organics from building products, carpet, and other office furnishings, cleaning activities and materials, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copier, and photography and printing shop; biological pollutants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.

<p>These guys have been excellent. At a realtor, I often need contractors to provide me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I required to contact these men twice.
