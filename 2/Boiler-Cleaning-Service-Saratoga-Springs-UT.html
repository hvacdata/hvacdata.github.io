<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
