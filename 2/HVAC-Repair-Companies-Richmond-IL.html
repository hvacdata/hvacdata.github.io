<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, offices and schools matters, especially given that we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases trigger the system to close down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be done in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
