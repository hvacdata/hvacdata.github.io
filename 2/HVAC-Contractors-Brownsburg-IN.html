There are emergency safety changes that protect your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you may have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
