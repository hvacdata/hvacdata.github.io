<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
