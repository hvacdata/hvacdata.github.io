<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, individualized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style gets along, appealing and efficient. He clearly and thoroughly described all problems and repairs in a manner that made me positive in his ability to resolve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my wife and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in recent memory. He also responded to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to an issue that couldn't be solved on the very first check out due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to deliver constant, quality service.<p>
