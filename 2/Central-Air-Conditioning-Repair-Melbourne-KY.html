<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

In a situation where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold remediation may be required.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
