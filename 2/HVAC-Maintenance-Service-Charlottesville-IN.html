<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
