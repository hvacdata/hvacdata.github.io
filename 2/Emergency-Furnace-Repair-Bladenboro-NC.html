<p>Many people are ending up being more mindful and worried about their health and the effect of indoor air quality.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
