<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is far more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a car radiator or typical home a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
