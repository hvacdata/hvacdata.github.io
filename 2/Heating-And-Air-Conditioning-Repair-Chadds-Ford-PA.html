<p>Both should be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean the condenser coil.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
