<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Due West SC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
