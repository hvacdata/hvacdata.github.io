<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
