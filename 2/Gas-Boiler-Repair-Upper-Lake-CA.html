<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Upper Lake CA</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
