<h3>Heat Ventilation in Burlington Indiana</h3>
<p>Many people underestimate the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air pollution is usually pictured as the black smoke given off from factories.

To compound the issue, it is estimated that the typical American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and more than half that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
