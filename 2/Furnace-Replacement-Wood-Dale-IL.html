<p>Collins Aerospace ventilation systems improve your flight experience by providing fresh air, improving food safety and cooling your flight-critical and flight-essential electronic devices. An alternative to packaged systems is the use of different indoor and outside coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and widely used worldwide except in The United States and Canada. In The United States and Canada, split systems are most often seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial structures.

<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
