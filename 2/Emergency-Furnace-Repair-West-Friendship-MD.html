<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well.
