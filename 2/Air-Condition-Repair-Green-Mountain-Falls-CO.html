<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Green Mountain Falls CO</h3>
<p>Among the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is since something is stopped up or filthy Prior to trying to repair any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
