<p>PE companies tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
