<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater need relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit resemble those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations).

The collector's glass can be washed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>

These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering into the building.

<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
