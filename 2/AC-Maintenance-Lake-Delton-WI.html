<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, because the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

More recent gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
