<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
