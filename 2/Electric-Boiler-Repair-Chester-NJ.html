<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling several spaces at once, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.
