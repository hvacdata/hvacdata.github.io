<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heater (like a space heating system) with the exact same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
