<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is utilized to transfer the heat to the rooms. Most modern hot water boiler heater have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
