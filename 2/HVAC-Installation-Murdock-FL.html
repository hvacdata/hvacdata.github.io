<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation many years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
