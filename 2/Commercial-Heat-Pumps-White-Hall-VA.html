<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this.
