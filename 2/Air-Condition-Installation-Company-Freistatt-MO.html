<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.

He dealt with the concern in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I thought about fair prior to he recalled, understood what might have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
