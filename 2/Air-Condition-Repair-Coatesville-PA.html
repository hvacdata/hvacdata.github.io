<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
