<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very pleasant person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
