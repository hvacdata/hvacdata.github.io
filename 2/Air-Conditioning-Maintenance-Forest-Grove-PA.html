<p>There is an essential balance in making your decision though as systems with higher AFUE scores typically include greater cost. So, make sure to decide based on how often you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For many temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter season, having a super high ranked heating unit is not constantly necessary.<p>
<p>Because heating and cooling work might also require setting up or repairing pipes to provide oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor may also be needed to hold a separate plumbing professional's license or have a certified plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this kind of work. When getting a price quote, make certain to ask not just if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
