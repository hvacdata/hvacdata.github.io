<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
