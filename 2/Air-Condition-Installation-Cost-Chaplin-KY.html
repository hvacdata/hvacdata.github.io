<p>The predominant health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
