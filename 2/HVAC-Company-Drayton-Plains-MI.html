<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air.

Many times, these systems consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
