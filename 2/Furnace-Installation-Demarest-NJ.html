<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing.

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his examination, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
