<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
