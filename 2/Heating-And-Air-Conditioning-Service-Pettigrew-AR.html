<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
