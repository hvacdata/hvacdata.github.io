<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
