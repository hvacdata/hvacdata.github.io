<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
