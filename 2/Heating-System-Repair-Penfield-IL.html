<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
