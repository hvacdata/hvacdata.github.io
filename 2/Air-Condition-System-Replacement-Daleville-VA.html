<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
