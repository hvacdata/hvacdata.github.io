<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Macks Creek MO</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>

After extensive trials in Arizona, where the system had to keep researchers and their equipment cool and dry, our innovation is now all set for extra-terrestrial responsibility.<p>
