<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
