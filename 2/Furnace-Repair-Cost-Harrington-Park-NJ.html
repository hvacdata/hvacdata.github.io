<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
