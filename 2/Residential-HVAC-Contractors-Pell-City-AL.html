<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
