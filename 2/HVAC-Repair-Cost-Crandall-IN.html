<p>These men have been terrific. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I needed to call on these guys two times. They came out rapidly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, its an organisation design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
