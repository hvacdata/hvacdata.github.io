<p>Many individuals undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination issue. Air pollution is generally visualized as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air leaves the system.<p>
