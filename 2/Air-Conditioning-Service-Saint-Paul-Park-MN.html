As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>Through regular usage and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit might become extremely dirty. These elements of the equipment are important for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and examines connections to ensure they are secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for correct function and overall condition. This is an exceptional chance to determine parts that are worn or malfunctioning. Changing them to fix the a/c may be a lot less costly when the issue is fairly small.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
