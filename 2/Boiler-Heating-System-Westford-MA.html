After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
