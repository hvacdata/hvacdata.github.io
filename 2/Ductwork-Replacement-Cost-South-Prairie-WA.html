<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's probably your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they come to perform regular maintenance?

She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
