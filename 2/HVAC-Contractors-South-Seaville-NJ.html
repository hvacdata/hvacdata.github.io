<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about alternatives.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become blocked, reducing air flow volume, quality, and circulation.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be appropriately kept to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to keep and comprehend.<p>
