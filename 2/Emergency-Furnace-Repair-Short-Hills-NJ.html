<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
