<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Rion SC</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially huge problem in the establishing world.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs entirely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
