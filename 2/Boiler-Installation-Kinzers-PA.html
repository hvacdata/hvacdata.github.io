<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and work environments matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
