<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was type of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space a/c offers maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
