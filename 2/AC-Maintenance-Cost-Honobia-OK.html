<p>Generally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more affordable approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can in some cases be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
