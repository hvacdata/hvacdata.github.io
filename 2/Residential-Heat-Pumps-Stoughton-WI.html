<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
