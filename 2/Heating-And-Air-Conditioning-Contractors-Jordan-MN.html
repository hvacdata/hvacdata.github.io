<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
