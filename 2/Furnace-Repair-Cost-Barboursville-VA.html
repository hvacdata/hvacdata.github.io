The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
