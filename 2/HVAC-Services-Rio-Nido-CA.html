An option to packaged systems is the use of different indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and commonly utilized worldwide other than in North America. In North America, divided systems are frequently seen in residential applications, but they are gaining popularity in small commercial structures. The split systems are a fantastic choice for little structures where ductwork is not feasible or where the area conditioning performance is of prime issue. 19 The advantages of ductless a/c systems include easy installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, versatility of control and peaceful operation. citation required In area conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption. 20 The use of minisplit can lead to energy cost savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more difficulties, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
