Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation company completely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
