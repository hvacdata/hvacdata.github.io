<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace must likewise be examined frequently. Leaking gas and fuel can be a fire risk. Detached fuel lines can jeopardize the performance of the HVAC system also. Soot can accumulate in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's efficiency too.
