<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
