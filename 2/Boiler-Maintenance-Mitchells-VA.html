While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
