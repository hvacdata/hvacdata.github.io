Numerous typical structure products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
