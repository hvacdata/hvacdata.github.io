<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
