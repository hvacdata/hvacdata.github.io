<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
