<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, faulty or missing wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves checking the advised connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are safe and secure and tight.<p>

By contrast, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be done in simply a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
