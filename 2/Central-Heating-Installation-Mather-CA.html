<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma might discover being inside your home offers the best relief, if the indoor air environment is good.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
