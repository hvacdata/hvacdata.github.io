<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Lakebay WA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is safeguarded inside.

New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
