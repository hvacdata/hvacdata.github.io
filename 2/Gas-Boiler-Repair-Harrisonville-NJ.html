<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Ensure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
