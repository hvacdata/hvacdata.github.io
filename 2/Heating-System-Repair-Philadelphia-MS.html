<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
