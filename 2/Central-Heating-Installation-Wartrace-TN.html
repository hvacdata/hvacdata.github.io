<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
