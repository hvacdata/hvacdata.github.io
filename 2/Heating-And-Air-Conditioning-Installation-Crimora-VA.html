<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Crimora VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
