<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

Briefly increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
