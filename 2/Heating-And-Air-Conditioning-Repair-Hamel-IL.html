<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
