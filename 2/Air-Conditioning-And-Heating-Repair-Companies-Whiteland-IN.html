<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I have actually got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic utilized worldwide, including EMV. He's said several times that the unique code feature is optional and many, many retailers do not use it since it slows down deals much more due to the back-and-forth communications required. If that is even possible, I do not understand enough about the innovation to know.<p>
<p>Choosing the right size a/c is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the right size ac system matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll end up wasting money and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you've offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
