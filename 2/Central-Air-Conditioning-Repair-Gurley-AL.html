<p>Some biological impurities set off allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Mildews and molds release disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health issue brought on by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
