<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
