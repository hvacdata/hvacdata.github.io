<p>. Before choosing the installation location of air conditioner, a number of primary factors need to be considered. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems must not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Second of all, there must not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor system must also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the productivity of the entire system will drop greatly. It is highly suggested to install the ac system units in quickly available locations, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
