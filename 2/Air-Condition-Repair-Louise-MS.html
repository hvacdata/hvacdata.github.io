<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
