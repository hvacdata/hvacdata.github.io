<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
