<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
