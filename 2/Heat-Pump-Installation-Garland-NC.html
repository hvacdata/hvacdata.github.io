<h3>Best Portable Air Conditioner in Garland NC</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The installation was quickly, professional and very well done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and acknowledge easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on detail that develops a task effectively done. I very highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and gratitude for a task well done.<p>
