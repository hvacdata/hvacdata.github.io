<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater salaries for air conditioning tradesmen. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for proficient trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average earnings for HVAC technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
