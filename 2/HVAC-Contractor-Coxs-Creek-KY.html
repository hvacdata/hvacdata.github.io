<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs totally by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
