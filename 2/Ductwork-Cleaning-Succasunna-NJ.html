<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>As you generally require to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating system, you need to factor in the time it takes for this to totally dry prior to the flooring covering can be put in location - this is generally a day or 2.

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreparable lung scarring that can be fatal). Signs of these diseases do not show up until many years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from task sites.<p>
