<p>Since the 1980s, makers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can likewise help increase occupant health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually imposed tighter restrictions over the years. There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
