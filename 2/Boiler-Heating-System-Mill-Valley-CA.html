<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
