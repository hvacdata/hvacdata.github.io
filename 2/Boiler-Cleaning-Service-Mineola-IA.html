<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Mineola Iowa</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your home. This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the evaluation on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
