<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear soon after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term.

<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency equipment available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air leaves the system.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
