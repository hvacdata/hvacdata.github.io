Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
