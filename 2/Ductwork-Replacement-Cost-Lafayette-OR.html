<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size.
