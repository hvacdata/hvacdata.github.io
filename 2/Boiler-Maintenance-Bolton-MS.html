<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>Some health effects may appear shortly after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might appear, be exacerbated or intensified.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or normal home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
