<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the home. Pollutants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care items. Infections and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, consider possible impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
