If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
