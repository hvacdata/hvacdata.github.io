<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
