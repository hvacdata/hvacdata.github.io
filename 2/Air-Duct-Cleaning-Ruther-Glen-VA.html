<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, pet hair and other particles cause issues like failure to provide appropriate heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives variety from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. If the technician comes to your house, that may be an extremely expensive dirty-filter medical diagnosis. This kind of cleaning work should be performed in a regular basis, so a furnace tune-up is needed, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
