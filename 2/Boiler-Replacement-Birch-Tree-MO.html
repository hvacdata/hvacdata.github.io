<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
