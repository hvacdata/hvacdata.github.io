<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Rexmont PA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofings, floors, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
