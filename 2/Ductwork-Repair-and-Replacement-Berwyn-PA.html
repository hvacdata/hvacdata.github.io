A structure walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leaks, dirt or insect droppings may be valuable. Leaks need to be eliminated.

In some situations, specific screening for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
