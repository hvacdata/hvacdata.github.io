<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at La Grange Park IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
