<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.

<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may already be changing. Though just 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate systems have actually been built in the 4 years since or are currently under construction.
