<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Ventilation Systems in Summit AR</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the present one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
