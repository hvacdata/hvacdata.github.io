<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
