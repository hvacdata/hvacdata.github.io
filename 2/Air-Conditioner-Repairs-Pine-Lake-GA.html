<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building products, smoking, family products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured products. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing products.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
