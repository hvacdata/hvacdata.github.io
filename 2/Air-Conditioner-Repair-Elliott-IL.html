<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
