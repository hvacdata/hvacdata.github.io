<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous.

<p>My oldest boy always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
