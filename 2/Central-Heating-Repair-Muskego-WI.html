<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
