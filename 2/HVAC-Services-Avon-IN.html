<p>The most common type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey choice, however newer systems can be extremely energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely efficient natural gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
