<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
