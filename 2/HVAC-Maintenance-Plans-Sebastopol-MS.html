<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which generally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Consider prospective impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly guidelines on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in usage, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
