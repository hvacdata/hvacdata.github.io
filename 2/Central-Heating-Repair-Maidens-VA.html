<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Maidens VA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
