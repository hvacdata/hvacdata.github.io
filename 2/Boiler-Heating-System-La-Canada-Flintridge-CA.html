<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
