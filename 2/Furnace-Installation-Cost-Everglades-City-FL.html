<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
