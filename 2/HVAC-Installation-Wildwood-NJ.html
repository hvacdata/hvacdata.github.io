<p>Many home products release natural vapors that can cause unfavorable health effects. These effects may consist of nose and throat irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, and queasiness.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.
