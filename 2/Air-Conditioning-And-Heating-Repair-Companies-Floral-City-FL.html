<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Filthy Filters: â $ " Â Filters blocked with dust, animal hair and other particles lead to issues like failure to supply appropriate heat, excess sound and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you spend for. If the technician concerns your house, that might be an extremely costly dirty-filter medical diagnosis. This kind of cleaning work should be done in a routine basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, check our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
