<p>There is no simple response, however many use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of contaminant sources is often essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
