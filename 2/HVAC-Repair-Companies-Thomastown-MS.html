<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, an expert service individual ought to be called for almost any maintenance besides regular cleaning.

<p>A/c can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air.

While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
