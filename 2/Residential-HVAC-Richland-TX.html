<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are less typical now than gas, but they can be useful in more remote regions where energies are harder to gain access to, and in colder climates due to the fact that it supplies more heat per BTU than other services. The installation cost will be lower, however energy costs will be higher, as much as 3 times higher than gas or electric furnaces. They require a tank on the immediate residential or commercial property and more maintenance. In general, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. Overall, they supply an AFUE rating of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
