<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
