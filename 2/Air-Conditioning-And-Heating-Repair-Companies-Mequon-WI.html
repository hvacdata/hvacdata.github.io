<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators prohibited. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-404a and r-134a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of toxin direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Area control includes moving the contaminant source away from residents and even relocating prone residents.<p>

<p>EPA's Total Exposure Assessment Approach (GROUP) research studies found levels of about a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside houses than outdoors, regardless of whether the homes were located in highly commercial or rural areas. Extra GROUP studies suggest that while people are utilizing products including organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
