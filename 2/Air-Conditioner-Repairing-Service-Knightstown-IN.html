A furnace that is too small, on the other hand, will not be able to supply enough heat to keep your house comfy.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE scores frequently include greater price. So, ensure to decide based on how often you will use your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.
