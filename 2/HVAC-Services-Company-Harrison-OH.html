<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Harrison OH - The Benefits</h3>

Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.
