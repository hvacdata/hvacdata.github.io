<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Magnolia NC Home</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
