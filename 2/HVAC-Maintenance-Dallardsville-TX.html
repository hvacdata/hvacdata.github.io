<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my needs entirely by offering an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
