<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
