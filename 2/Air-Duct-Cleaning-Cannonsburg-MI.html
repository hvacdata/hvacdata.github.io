<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
