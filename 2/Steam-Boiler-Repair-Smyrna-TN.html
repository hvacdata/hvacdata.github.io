<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, since all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
