<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy consumption and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores change outside of an acceptable variety that could avoid clients from shopping at the store.<p>
