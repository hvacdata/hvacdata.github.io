These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling impact.
