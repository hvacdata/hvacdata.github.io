<p>Bear in mind that the SEER ranking is determined using the very same set of temperature levels throughout the board. The typical summer temperature to arrive at the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to come to the correct SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83.

<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
