<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
