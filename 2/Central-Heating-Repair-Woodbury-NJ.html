<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
