<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been shown to trigger the health results pointed out.
