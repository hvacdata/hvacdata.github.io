<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Hoagland IN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
