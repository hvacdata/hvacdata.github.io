I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
