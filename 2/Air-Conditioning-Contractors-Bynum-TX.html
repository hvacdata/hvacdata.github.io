Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents or even transferring prone residents.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks.
