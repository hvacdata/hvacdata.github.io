<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and structure residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning products, building and construction home furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
