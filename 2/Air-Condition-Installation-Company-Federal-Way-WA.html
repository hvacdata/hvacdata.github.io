<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
