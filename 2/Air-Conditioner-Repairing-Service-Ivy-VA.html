<p>All cooling contractors need to begin their evaluation of your house by performing an A/c Contractors of America Manual J load calculation. This determines the heat gain your house undergoes. The calculation is reasonably easy to perform and will expose what size unit you need. If the one you're thinking about desires to determine the ideal unit for your house solely on experience, move on to another contractor. Though strongly influenced by where you live, numerous aspects affect the size unit required, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The calculation can also alert you to the possible advantages of upgrading the insulation in your house. By making your home more energy effective, you may be able to reduce the size of the ac system you need.<p>
