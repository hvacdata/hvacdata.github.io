<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The essential part of your air conditioning is the outdoor system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its positioning on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter.

This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the very same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
