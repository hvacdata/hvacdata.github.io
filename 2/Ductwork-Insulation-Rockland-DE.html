<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
