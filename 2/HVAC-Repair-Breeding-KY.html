<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just including refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A trained technician ought to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>

Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Since an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
