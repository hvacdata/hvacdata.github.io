Many common building materials utilized before 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
