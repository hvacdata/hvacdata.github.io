<p>Check these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.

<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Inspecting and altering the air filters is among the most important elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
