<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
