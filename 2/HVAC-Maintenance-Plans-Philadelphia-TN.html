<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some time. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, previously this year. Audex had owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
