<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period. Essentially, SEER supplies more data based upon how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
