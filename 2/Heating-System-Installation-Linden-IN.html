<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
