<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo looks for more than just extra revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or provide a new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out limited pipes work for select clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, enabling an enhanced value proposition for a wider set of customers.<p>
