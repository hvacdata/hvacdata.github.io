<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Ossian IN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
