<p>The residential or commercial properties and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These need to be taken into account prior to selecting the best design of an underground cooling and heating system. Soil with positive heat transfer properties requires less pipelines to achieve the desired underground heating & cooling result, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will require more pipelines.<p>
<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air contaminant could likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable organic compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
