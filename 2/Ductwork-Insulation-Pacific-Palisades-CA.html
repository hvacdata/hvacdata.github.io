<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
