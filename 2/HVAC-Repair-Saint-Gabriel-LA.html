The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
