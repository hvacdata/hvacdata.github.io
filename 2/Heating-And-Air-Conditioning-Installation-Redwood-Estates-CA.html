<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
