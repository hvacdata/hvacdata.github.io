<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
