<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
