<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Second of all, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
