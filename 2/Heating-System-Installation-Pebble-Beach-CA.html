<p>Generally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
