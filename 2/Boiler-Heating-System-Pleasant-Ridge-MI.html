<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, particularly in an older house. Depending on the type of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and equipment may need special authorizations, and there is minimal flexibility in the event of changed heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your house heating system. Low-efficiency models will cost less, but result in greater energy bills. High-efficiency models cost more, but conserve more over the long haul. Rates for gas heaters vary from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models as much as $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric furnaces begin at $395 and vary as much as $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>
