<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
