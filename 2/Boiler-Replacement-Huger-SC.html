<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
