<p>Immediate results may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Think about a whole home dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old adequate to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices.

<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit.

While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
