<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to keeping a correct temperature.<p>
<p>You could update to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The average house's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
