These aspects consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering the building. Often, specific pollutants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
