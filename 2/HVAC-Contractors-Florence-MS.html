The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
