<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided great customer service at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but numerous use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution.
