He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
