<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating.

Sometimes, totally brand-new ductwork might require to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
