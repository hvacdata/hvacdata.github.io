<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
