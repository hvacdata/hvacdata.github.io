<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
