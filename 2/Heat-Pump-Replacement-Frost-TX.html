<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
