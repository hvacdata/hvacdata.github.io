Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have.
