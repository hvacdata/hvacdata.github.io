Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
