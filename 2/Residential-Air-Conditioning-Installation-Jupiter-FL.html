<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Through normal use and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may end up being very filthy. These elements of the devices are crucial for efficient air conditioning.
