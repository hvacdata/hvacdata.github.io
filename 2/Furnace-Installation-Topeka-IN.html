He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
