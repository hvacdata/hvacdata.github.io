<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
