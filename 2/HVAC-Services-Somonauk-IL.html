During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
