Reedy chooses the owners remain on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My other half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent people I have satisfied in a long period of time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us.
