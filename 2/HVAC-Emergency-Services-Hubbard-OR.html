<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level.

However, new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
