<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioners, evaporative coolers count on the outdoors air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and maintain.<p>
