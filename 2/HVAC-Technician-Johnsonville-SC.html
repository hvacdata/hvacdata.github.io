<p>Making use of air filters can trap some of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Purification need to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>Picking the right size air conditioning system is a crucial part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to help you with.

Perhaps Realtors need to think about a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heat system might contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate.
