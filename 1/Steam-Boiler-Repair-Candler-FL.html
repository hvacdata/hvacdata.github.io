This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the house.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, a lot of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
