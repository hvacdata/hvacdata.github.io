<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
