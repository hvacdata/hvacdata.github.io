<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
