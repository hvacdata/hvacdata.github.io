<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Edgard LA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
