<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated performance advantage since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

Radiant heating systems don't distribute air at all, which really improves your indoor air quality by restricting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne impurities.<p>
<p>In addition, house owners have a range of alternatives to choose from in powering a floor heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.

If the marketplace for that energy source turns volatile, rates can fluctuate, costs surge and you can end up paying more to heat your house regardless of how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
