<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
