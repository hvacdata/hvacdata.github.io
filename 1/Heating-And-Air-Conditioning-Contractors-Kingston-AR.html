<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Kingston AR</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
