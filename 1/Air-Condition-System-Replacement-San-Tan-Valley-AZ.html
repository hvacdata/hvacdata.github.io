<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements.

The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
