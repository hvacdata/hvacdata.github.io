<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Philadelphia TN?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
