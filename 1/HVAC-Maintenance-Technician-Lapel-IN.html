<p>Buildings are designed or meant to respond actively to some of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building products, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, but much of the danger likewise originates from burning things.

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
