<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and harden-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
