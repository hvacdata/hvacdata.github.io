Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been properly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
