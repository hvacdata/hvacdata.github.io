<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
