<h3>Heat Pump Prices in Windyville Missouri</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.
