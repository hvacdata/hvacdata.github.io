The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
