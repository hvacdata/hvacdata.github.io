<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
