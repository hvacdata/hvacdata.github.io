<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
