<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
