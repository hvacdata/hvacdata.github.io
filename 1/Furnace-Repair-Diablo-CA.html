<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne item of a biological impurity. Biological contaminants in the house may consist of mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen.
