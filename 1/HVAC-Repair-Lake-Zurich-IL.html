<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Lake Zurich IL</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare occasions.<p>
