<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My better half said that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
