Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
