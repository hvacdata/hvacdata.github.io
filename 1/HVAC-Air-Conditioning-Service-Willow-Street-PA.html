<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
