<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and informative, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for remarkable service.

He included these significant but minor modifications in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>

Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts.
