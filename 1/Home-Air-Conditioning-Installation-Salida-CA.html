<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
