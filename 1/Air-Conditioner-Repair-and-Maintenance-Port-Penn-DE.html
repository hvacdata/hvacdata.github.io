<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about possible results of indoor air contamination. Follow the maker's directions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.

While an area heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
