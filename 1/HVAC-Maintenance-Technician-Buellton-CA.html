<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The crucial part of your cooling is the outdoor unit.

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.
