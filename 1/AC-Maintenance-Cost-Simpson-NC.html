<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Simpson NC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
