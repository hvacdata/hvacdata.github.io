<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
