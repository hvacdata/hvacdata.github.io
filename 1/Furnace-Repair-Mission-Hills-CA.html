<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
