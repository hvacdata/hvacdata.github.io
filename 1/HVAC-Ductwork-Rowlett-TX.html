If the signs fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions widespread in the home.<p>

The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Removal for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures vary, but often consist of really hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.
