<p>Just like most home improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the home. The majority of heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
