They weren't cheap but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
