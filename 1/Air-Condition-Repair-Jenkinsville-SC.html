<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
