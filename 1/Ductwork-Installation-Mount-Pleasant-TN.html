<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a good chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic.
