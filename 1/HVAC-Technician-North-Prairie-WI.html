Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
