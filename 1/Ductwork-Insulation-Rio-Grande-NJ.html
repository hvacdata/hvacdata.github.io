<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.
