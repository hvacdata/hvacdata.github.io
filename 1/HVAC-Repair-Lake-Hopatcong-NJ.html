<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
