<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Indian Hills CO</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and contamination. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>The main reason house owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the quantity of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a producer's service warranty, the cost might not be worthwhile. Any major repairs should be covered under the producer's warranty. However, some makers need regular maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
