<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
