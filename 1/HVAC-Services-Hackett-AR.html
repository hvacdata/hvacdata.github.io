It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
