<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had actually identified the difficulty location in examining the bill. He solved the concern in one day, had actually changed the expense to what I thought about reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place again.
