<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for residential and commercial HVAC organisations. HVAC service technicians go through a number of possibly harmful conditions. Service technicians are frequently needed to work in cramped locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofings of homes.

<p>The first a/c unit and fridges employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were informative and practical, Ballard Gas provided us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial however minor changes in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of current warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
