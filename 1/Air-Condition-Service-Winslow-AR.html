<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Winslow AR</h3>
<p>Ductless air conditioning is, of course, ideal for houses without ducts, but is likewise a versatile solution for a variety of other circumstances. Instead of pushing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and floor, ductless systems distribute air straight to specific spaces. Extremely cost-effective, and energy-efficient, and supplying higher control over when and where the air enters your house, All Points Heating can help you select the best ductless cooling system for your needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
