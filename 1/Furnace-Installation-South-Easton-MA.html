<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
