<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Lewiston NY</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
