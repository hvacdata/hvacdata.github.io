<p>Immediate results may show up after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are treatable and typically short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up not long after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people exhale co2, which in little quantities is not toxic, but might become hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread out throughout the whole office or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
