And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
