<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an ac system, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the ac system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool the house properly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the factors that you need to take into account.
