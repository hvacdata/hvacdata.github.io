<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
