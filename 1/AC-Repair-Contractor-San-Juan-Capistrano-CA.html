<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in San Juan Capistrano CA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Cooling, we believe in continuous education and training at our very own Bob's University. To ensure our installers and service technicians are at the forefront of HVAC technology and safety, we require weekly training meetings and bi-weekly security meetings.
