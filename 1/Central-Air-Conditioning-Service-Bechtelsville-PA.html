<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Bechtelsville PA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly efficient, since ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature level.

Just like other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
