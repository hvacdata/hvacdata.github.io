<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your house that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have actually been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that an affordable variety of houseplants remove substantial amounts of contaminants in houses and offices. Due to the fact that overly moist soil might promote the development of microbes which can affect allergic individuals, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
