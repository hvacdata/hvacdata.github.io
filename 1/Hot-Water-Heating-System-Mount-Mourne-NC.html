<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Mount Mourne NC?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
