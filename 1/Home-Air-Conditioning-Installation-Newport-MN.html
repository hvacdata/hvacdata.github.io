<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
