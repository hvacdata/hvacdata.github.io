<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
