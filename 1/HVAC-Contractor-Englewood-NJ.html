<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
