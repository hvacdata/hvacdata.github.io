<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those measurements on hand when shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.
