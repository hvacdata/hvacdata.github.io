<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
