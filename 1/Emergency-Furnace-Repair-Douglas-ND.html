<p>The heat pump got appeal in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from numerous sources, such as environmental air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heat pumps transfer heat from outside the structure into the air within.

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
