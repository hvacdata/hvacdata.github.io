<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the exact same indoor air issues as single-family homes because many of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure materials, home furnishings, and household products, are similar.

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really delighted they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
