<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain hazardous substances (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, as it associates with indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall.
