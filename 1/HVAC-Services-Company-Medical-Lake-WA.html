<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of typical building products used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimum due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically advised instead.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
