<h3>Facts All Rustburg VA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
