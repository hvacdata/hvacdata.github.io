<p>. Before picking the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main aspects need to be thought about. Firstly, the instructions of air flow from the indoor systems should not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the properties as much as possible. The outdoor unit should also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your home will not be successfully released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop sharply. It is extremely a good idea to set up the air conditioner units in quickly available places, for further maintenance during operation.<p>
