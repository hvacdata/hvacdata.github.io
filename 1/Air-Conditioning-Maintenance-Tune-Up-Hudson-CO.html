<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and seriousness of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
