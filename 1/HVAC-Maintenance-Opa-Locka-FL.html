<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Opa Locka FL</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for. They fulfilled my requirements completely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
