<p>I typically do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy.

For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the component.. a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
