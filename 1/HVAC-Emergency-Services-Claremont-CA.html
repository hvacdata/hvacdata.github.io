<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Claremont CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your home so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can lead to a dangerous accumulation and jeopardize your safety.

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the issue and fixed really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
