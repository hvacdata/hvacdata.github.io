Put simply, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
