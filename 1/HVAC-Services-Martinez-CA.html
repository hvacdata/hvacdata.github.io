<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to examine building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments vary from sophisticated tracer gas methods used mainly in building research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators. NIST scientists are constantly establishing brand-new test procedures, and then showing them in the field to examine their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has actually resulted in the advancement of an essential database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results discussed.

Oftentimes, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could take place.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
