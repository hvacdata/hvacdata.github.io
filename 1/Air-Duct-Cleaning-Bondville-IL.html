<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems at Bondville IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
