<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Winchester KY</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the home.<p>

When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the technicians thought they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
