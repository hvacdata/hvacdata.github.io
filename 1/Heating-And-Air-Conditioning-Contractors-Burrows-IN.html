<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
