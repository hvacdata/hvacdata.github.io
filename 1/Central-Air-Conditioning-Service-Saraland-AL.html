<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
