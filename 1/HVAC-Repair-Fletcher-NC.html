Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. However then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
