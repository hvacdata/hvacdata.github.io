<p>Remember, too, that you might wish to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capabilities. You may look for a heat pump more geared towards cooling capability and performance if you currently have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
