<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
