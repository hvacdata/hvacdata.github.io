The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>

Depending on the type of system installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>
