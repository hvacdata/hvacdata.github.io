<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me difficulty shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
