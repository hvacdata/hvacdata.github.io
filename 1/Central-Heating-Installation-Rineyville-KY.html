<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When picking a new furnace, there are lots of elements to consider. Trust our skilled technicians to set out all your options. We'll visit your house for a comprehensive assessment, including an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to find the very best system for your home.
