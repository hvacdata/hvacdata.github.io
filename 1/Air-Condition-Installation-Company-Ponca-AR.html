I'm likewise satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Only a professional can properly identify why your furnace isn't beginning. It's time to call a professional if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
