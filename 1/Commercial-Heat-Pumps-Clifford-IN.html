<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95).
