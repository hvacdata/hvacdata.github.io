<p>Expert heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new.
