<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on rare events.<p>
