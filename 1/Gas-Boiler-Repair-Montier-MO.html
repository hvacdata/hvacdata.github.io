They consist of delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues.

Kids may have higher direct exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
