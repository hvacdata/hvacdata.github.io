<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>We have been extremely pleased with Integrity's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked extremely well and is so efficient that it substantially lowered our energy expenditures - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years.
