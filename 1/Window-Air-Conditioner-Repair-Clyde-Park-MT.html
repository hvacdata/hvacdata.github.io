<p>We called Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to evaluate situation & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were really professional, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would extremely recommend this company.<p>

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
