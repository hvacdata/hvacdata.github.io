<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Outdoor pollutants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
