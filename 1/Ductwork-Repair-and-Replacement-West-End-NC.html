<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at West End NC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
