<p>In most cases, if materials have failed to dry a number of days after the presumed water event, mold development is thought within wall cavities even if it is not instantly visible. Through a mold investigation, which might include harmful inspection, one must have the ability to determine the presence or absence of mold. In a scenario where there is visible mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold removal might be required. Mold testing and examinations should be performed by an independent detective to avoid any dispute of interest and to insure accurate outcomes; complimentary mold screening used by removal companies is not advised.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
