<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is very important to be familiar with some of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home.
