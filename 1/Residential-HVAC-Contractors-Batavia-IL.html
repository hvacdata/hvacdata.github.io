Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to ensure that no consumer complaints have been submitted which the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and valid.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
