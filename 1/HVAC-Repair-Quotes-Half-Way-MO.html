Although you may think that emptying the space of all items that might catch fire sooner or later uses adequate safety, sometimes other scrap such as lint and dust might gather inside the furnace which might cause a fire.

<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.
