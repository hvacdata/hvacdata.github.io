<h3>Residential HVAC in Topanga CA</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has actually determined building materials, home furnishings, and mold as serious issues, however much of the risk likewise originates from burning things.

This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
