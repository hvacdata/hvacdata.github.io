<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Vincent AL</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
