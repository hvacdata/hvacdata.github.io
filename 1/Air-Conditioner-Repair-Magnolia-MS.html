The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, considering that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level.
