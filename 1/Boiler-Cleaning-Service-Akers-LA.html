Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

This suggests for every system of energy utilized to power the system, three to five systems are supplied as heat.<p>
