Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
