<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually offered it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
