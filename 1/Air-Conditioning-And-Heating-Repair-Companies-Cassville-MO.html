High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can likewise result from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>

Local building regulations most likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that ought to be constantly supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA).
