<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
