<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
