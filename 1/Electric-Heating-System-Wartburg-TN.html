<h3>How to Maintain Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Wartburg TN</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or replacing air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
