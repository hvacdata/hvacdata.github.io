The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate however a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on preserving it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
