<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
