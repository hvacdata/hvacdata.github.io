<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
