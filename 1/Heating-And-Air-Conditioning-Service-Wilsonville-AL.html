<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
