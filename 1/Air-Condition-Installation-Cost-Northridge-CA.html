<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
