<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
