<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
