However, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit.

<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
