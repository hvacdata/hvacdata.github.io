<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the growth of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution.

The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
