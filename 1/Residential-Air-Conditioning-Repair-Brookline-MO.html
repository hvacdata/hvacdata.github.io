<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can just be used when there is wind, while solar energy counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and available source of energy.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
