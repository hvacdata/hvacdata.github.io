<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
