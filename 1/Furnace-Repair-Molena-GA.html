<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
