<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
