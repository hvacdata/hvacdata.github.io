<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Locust Dale VA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
