<p>Simplify your services, earn more services income, and provide an incredible consumer experience. To make sure the unit you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation quote to identify the exact kind of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have.

This step is necessary so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can register for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance visits each year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other perks. Some companies offer top priority appointments to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
