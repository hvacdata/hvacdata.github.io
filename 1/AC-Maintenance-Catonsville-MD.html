<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit appears less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, heated up floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a significant renovation job, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is an appropriate service for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
