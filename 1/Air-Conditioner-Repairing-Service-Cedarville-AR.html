<p>Most people are aware that outside air contamination can affect their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have substantial, hazardous effect. EPA studies of human exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of pollutants may be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they ought to be positioned. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals mainly stay seated in that particular location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending on what toxin you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensing unit appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated issues-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the three tactics below may be suitable.<p>
