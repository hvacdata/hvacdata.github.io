<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
