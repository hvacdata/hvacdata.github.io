Our professionals describe all of your alternatives before beginning the repair, so you can choose whether a repair or replacement is best for you.

If you choose that replacing your furnace is the best strategy, we can install a brand-new, high-efficiency model in its place.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used poisonous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas heating systems While oil is generally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, as opposed to the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
