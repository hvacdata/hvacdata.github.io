<h3>Truth That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Gill CO</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
