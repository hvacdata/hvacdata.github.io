<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided guarantee will not do you any excellent should the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and work with a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
