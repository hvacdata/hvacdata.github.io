<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
