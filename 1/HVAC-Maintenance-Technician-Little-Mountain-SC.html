<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely important to keeping a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals suggest utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Little Mountain SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
