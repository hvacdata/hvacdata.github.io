<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Intensifying the noted health symptoms may be job stress. In part, due to different aspects of workplace automation, the most stressful components of office work are increasing.
