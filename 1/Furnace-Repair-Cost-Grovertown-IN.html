<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
