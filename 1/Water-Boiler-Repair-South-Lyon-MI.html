<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is simple to install, especially if you make it part of a build or restoration task.

We picked getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
