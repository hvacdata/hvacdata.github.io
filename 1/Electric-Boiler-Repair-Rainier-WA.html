<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that deals with indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic responsibility clause" applies. This stipulation, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that a company must supply a healthy and safe workplace. Thus, ensuring the air is of good quality is the company's task.<p>
<p>Many elements affect IAQ. These elements consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering the building. In some cases, particular contaminants like dust from building or renovation, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
