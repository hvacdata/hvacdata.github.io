<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
