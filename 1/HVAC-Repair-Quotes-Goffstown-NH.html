<p>You're motivating the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
