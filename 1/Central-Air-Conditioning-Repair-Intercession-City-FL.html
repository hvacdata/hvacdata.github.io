<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

<p>Geothermal heatpump are incredibly effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling impact. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
