<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
