<p>Professional heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than necessary.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy efficient than models made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's five years old or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while delivering the exact same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
