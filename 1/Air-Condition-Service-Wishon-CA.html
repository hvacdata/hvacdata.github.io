<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
