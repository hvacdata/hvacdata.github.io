<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
