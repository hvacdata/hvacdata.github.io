<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to individual.

<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace devices, cleaning products, building carpets, home furnishings and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor contaminants.
