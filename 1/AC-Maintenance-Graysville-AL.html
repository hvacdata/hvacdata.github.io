<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. When the belt that links the motor to the blower slips, screeching sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally take place. Most of the times, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
