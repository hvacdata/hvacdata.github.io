<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location.
