<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime.

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
