<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To detect smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
