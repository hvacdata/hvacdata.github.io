<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
