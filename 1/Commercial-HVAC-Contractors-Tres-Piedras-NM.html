(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
