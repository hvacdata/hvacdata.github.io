When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop inside your home, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

Signs of these illness do not show up till many years after direct exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed disease from direct exposure to clothes and devices brought house from job sites.<p>
