<h3>Air Condition Repair in San Bernardino California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>To be truthful, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service concerned us because of that. Most of the time they were at first interested in from another location monitoring some other aspect of their structures, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they learned about and executed indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a much healthier, safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable consequences associated with indoor air contaminants.<p>
