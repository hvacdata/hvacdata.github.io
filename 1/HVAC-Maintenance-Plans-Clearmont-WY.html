<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Clearmont</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of delays in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, kids, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
