<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Mauk</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
