<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture.
