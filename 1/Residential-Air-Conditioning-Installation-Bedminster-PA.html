Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
