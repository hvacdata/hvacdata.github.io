<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour.

I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
