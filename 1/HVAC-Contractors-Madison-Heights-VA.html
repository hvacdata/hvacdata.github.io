Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
