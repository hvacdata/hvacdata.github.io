<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is currently widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
