<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might enter close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
