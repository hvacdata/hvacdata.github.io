<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Contact a professional each year prior to winter hits to ensure your heating and cooling parts are running optimally. It is also essential to bear in mind that air impurities are universal and tend to have deep-rooted sources in the house's ventilation system. Asking a technician to thorough tidy or change parts that host irritants such as dust, mold, mildew, and germs can improve your health and that of your household.<p>
