<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
