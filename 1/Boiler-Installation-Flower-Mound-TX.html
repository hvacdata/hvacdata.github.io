<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health effects discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally found in the house. Oftentimes, our understanding of the pollutants and their health results is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could happen.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your tracking equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the scenario right away.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference area. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more intricate problems-- identified by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the concern you're experiencing, one of the three methods listed below might be suitable.<p>
