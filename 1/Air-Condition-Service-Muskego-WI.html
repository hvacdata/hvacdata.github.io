<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Muskego WI</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the absence of such legislation, the "basic task stipulation" applies. This clause, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that a company must offer a safe and healthy  work environment. Thus, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's responsibility.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
