<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that ideal temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which generally consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
