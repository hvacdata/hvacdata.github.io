<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Radiant heating offers a variety of distinct advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transferring heat through strong objects will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house warmed by a glowing system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
