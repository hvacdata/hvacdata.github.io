<p>When central air service fails during a heat spell, you may have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll probably pay a minimum of several hundred for the repair.

Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
