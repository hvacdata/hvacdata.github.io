<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Sheridan IN HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction.

<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open.

The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
