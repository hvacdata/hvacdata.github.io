<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Mount Aetna PA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's products and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
