<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
