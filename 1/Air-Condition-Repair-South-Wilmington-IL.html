<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
