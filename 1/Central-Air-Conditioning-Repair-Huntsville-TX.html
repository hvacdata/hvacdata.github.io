<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems.

<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.
