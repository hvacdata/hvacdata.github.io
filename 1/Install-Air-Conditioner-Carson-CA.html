<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
