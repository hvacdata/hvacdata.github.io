<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

Porous products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may end up being a source for mold development and should be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in surprise or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
