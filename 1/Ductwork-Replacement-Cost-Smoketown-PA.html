<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
