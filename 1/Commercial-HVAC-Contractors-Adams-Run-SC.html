The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
