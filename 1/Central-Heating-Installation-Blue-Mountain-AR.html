<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service at Blue Mountain AR</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
