<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were courteous and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on information that creates a job effectively done. I really highly recommend the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>

Geothermal heat pumps usually need excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
