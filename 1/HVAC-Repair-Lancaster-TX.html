<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a greater occurrence of resident breathing issues.<p>
