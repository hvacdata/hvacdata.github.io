<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside offices, schools, and other offices is necessary not just for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, tiredness, problem focusing, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Likewise, some particular diseases have actually been linked to particular air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant symptoms but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
