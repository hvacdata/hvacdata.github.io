<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office to perform our workshops and needed some heating. After contacting Stability we were provided a terrific quote on a radiant floor system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming event, and Tyler came right out and had us hooked up in a number of days. The systems works terrific and the new workplace feels very comfy. It was a pleasure working with such a professional company and would highly suggest them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
