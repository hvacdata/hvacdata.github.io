This identifies the heat gain your home is subject to. The estimation is fairly simple to carry out and will reveal what size unit you need.

Though strongly affected by where you live, numerous factors affect the size unit needed, consisting of the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of windows and doors; and the orientation of your house to the sun. The calculation can also notify you to the possible benefits of upgrading the insulation in your home.
