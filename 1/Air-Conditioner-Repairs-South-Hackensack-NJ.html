<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes inspecting the suggested connections as well as temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making certain that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations build up inside.<p>
