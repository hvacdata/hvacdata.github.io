<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Vernon Hills IL?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by numerous people.<p>

I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
