<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
