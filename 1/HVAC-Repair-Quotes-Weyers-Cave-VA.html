<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
