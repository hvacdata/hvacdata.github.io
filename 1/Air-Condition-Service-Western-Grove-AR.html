<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
