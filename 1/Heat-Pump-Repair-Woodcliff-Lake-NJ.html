<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course.

However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
