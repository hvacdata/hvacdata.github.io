<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Airville PA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems ought to be examined a minimum of two times each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
