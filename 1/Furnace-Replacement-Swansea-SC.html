<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.
