<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heating unit will strive for you, however like your automobile, doing regular and routine maintenance will keep it running smoothly, prevent problems, and keep your service warranty undamaged.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
