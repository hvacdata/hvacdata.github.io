<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>AC Replacement Service in Troutville VA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
