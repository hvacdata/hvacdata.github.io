<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
