<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
