<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
