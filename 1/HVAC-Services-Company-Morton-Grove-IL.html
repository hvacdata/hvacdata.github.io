<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stinky or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To find smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
