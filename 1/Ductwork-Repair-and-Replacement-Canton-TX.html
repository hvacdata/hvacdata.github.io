<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
