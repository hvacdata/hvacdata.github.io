<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these actions as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating systems, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might also choose to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather licenses.<p>
