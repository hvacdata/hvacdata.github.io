<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
