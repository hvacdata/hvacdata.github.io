<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
