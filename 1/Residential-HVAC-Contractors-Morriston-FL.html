<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
