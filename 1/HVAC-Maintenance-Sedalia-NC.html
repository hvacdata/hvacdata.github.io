<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
