<h3>Air Condition Repair in Sandgap KY</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
