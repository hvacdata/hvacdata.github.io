<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
