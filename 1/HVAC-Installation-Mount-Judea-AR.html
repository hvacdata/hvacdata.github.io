Environment Pro is reputable and truly appreciated us and our circumstance. We got home one evening to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that very same night.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
