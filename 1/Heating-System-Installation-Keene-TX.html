<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Keene TX</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Many home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
