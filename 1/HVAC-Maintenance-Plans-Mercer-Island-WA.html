<h3>Advantages of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Mercer Island WA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
