<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the difficulty location in examining the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a plan to insure that it would not take place again. I have considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, think about prospective results of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's instructions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit properly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
