<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house.

<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your company must examine measurements of humidity, air and temperature level circulation. In addition, evaluation and testing of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make certain it is working according to requirements for developing usage and tenancy) should be performed. A structure walk-through to look for smells and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings may be useful. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofings and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or germs and need to be removed, also. In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure occupancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Threat Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or common family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>
