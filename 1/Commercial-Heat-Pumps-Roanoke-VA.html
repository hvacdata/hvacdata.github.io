<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>They were excellent! So many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially asked for.

The also promptly followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round.
