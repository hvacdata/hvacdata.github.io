<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Branchdale PA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems need to be inspected at least two times each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
