<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really useful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
