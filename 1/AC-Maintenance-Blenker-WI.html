<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Evaluation of this information might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
