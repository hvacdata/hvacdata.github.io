<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, volatile organic substances ), particulates, microbial pollutants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stressor that can induce adverse health conditions.

<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
