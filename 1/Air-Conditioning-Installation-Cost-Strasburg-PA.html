<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the basic indoor air quality meets a particular standard. Occupational exposure limits listed in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limit Worths ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to prevent disease or particular effects (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial circumstances. These limitations might not be appropriate in workplace settings or for the home.<p>
