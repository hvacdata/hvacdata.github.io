Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect.
