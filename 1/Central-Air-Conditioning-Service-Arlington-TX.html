Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00.

We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and then switch it ON.
