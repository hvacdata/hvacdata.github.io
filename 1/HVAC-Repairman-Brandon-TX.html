<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
