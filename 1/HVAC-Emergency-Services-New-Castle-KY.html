<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Increasing energy costs are not the only reason for high expenses. Heating systems often lose their effectiveness as they age, particularly if they have not been correctly preserved. As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to offer the very same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to go up. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies every month might be utilized to assist you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
