Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its looks in the beginning. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Numerous elements impact IAQ. These elements consist of bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering into the structure.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
