<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went on and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well.

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
