<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
