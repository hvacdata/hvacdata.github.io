<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
