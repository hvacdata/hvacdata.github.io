<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
