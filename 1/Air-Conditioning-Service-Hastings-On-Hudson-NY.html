Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
