<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
