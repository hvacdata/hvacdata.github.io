<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of heating systems have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
