<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
