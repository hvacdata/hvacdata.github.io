<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
