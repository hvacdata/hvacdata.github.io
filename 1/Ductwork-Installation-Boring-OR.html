<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
