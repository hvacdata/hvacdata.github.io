<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, since it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>If your single stage a/c unit isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, consider a whole house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and making it possible for higher convenience at greater temperatures.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
