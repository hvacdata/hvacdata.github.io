<p>New air conditioners normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating suggests higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy costs. An excellent SEER score for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally enabled SEER ranking is going to be far more energy effective than your present, old air conditioner. It's not constantly about choosing the design with the highest SEER ranking, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>Great Item! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this item to anybody who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Old heating systems often begin to make some odd noises as they get toward the end of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching sounds coming from your furnace? Another noise is when you hear the furnace blower running exceedingly. These noises are brought on by a variety of issues like unsecured ductwork, motor failure, an unbalanced motor or deteriorating parts. Does your blower turn on and off often or does it blow cold air often? If so, this is an indication that your furnace may need to be replaced.<p>
