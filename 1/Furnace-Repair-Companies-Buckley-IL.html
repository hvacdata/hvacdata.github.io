<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators.

Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
