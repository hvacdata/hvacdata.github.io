<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda.
