<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not use them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
