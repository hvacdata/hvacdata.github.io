<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
