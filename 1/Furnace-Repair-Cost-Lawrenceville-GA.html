In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
