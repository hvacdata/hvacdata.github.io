<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
