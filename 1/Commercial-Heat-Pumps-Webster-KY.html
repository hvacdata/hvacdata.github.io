<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous aspects consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
