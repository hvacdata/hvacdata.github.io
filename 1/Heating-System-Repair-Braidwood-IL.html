<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside.

However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
