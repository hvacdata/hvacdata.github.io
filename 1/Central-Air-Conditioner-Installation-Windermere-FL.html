<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
