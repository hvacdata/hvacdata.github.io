The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually checked at least. This assessment is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. You won't observe a problem up until it stops working in the middle of winter if you don't get your system examined. Because you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you want. Regular examination and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>
