The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future.

<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually checked at least. This assessment is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. You won't observe a problem up until it stops working in the middle of winter if you don't get your system examined.
