<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
