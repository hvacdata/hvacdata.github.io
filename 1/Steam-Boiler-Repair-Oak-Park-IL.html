The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter neighboring ventilation intakes.

The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
