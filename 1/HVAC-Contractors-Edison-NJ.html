<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Edison New Jersey</h3>
<p>These men have been terrific. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I needed to get in touch with these men two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Stability isn't just their name, its a company model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
