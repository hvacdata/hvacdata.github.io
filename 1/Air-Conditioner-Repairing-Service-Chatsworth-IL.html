<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure.
