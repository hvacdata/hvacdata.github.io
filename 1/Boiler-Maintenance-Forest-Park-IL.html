<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin.

<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
