<p>You're encouraging the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can likewise aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.
