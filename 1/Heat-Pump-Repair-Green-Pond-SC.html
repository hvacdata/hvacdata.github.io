<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>

ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity ought to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
