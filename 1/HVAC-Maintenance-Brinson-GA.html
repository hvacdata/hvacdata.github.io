<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
