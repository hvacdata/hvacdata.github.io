<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must recognize the variety of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; identify where they lie within the workplace; indicate when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; determine all machines operated in the workplace; suggest the kind of outdoors air contamination; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
