<p>Air flow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure distinctions created by these forces move airborne toxins from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to flow and rise out high building openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outdoors air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use really little energy, however care needs to be taken to make sure convenience. In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
