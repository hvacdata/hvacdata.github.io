<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>If your central air conditioning conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running, it might just need to be cleaned up. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's a great early remedy to try. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never ever use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are guidelines; constantly refer to your owner's handbook. Note: Always shut off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>
