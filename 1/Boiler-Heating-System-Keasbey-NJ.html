<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
