<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
