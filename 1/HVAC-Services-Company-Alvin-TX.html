<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
