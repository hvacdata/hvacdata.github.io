<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Monsey NY</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

A voided guarantee will not do you any good ought to the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the outset and work with a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
