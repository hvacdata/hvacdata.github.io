<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>

The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
