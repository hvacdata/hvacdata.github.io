<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
