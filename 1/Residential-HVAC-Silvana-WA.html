<p>For whole home setups, it's tough, if almost impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of spaces like restrooms, kitchens or utility room are quickly refurbished with electric radiant floor heat. This is far more cost-efficient on a smaller sized scale. Bigger restorations like additions to a home may be suitable for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>

When we do any repair, the parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts guarantee.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
