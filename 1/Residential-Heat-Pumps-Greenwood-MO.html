<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment and large homes. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and wear.

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed issues. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
