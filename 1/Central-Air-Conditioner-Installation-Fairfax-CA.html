According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>My eldest boy constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
