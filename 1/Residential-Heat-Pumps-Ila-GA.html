<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in homes.

<p>For instance, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly located outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.

<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air course.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
