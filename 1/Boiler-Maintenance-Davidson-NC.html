<h3>AC Unit Repair in Davidson NC</h3>
<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water.

More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
