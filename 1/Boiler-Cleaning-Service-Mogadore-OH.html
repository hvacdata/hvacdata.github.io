Must you experience any of these, air out your home, open a window to the furnace space and immediately call a service technician.

Found in Levittown, we serve consumers in Bucks County and the surrounding location. We are licensed and insured to do business in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.

<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply suggestions to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>We suggest annual preventative Maintenance for your heating and cooling systems. Maintenance services will not only assure that your system is running as effectively as possible, however will likewise guarantee security. From changing your systems filters and lines, to inspecting the voltages for electronic components, we run an in-depth maintenance check. Give us a call today to arrange your maintenance service.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
