<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Grand Haven MI</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other structures can be more seriously contaminated than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people spend around 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for many individuals, the threats to health might be higher due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
