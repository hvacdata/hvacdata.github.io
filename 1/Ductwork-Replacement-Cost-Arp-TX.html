<p>The purpose of most building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at sensible energy expenses. Load determining is referred to as the Manual J estimation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. As with determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
