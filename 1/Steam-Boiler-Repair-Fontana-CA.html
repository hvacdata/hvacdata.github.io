Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.
