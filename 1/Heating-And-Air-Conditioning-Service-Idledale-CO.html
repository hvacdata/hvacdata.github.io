<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
