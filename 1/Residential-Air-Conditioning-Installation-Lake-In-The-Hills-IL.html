To make sure the system you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load computation estimate to identify the specific type of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we don't simply replace it with the very same size system you presently have.

This step is essential so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
