<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions.
