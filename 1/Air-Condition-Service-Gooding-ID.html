<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done.

<h3>Furnace Installation in Gooding Idaho</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
