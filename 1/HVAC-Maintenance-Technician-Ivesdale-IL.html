<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
