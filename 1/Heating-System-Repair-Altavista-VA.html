Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
