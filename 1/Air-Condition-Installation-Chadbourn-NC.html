<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, babies, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children may have higher exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
