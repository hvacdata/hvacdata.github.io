<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.
