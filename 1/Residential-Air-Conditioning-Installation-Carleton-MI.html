<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and choose to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, property owners can expect to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.)
