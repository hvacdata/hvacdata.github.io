<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
