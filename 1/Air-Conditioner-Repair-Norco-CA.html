There are emergency security changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.
