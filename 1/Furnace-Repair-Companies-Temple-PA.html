<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
