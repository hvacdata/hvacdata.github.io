<p>Radiant heating provides a variety of unique advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.

Transferring heat through strong objects will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a glowing system will heat up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
