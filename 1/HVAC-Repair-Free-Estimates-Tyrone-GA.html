<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
