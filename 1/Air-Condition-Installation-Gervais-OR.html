<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
