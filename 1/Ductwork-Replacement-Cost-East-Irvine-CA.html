<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
