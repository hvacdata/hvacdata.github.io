<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Canton MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
