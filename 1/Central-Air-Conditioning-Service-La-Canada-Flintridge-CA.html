<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have breathing problems, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
