<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an efficient, correctly developed and operating ventilation system.

This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning offers maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
