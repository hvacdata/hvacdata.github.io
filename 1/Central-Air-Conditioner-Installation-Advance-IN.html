<p>Certain immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is very important to take note of the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the house and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be worsened by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Individuals have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because these activities create large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for ideas on which personal laboratories or public agencies might be able to help evaluate your house for lead in paint. House test kits can not find small amounts of lead under some conditions. Work with an individual with special training for correcting lead paint problems to eliminate lead-based paint. Residents, especially children and pregnant women, need to leave the building up until all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed.
