<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and effectiveness if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
