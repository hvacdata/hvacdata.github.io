<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Location control involves moving the contaminant source far from residents or even relocating susceptible residents.<p>
<p>The fuel lines that supply gas to your furnace need to also be inspected regularly. Dripping gas and fuel can be a fire hazard. Disconnected fuel lines can jeopardize the effectiveness of the HVAC system also. Soot can collect in burners and split heat exchanger s can have an impact on the system's effectiveness too. The maintenance. specialists will assess all of these elements of the furnace and thoroughly and remove all blockages and traces of soot.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
