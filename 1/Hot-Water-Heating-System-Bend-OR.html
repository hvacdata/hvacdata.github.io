There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to substantially decrease exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Consequently, the most reliable method to lower direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
