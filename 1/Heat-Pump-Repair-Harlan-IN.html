<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of insufficient combustion.
