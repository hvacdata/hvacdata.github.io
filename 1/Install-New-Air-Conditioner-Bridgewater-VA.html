<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Bridgewater VA</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have met in a long period of time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
