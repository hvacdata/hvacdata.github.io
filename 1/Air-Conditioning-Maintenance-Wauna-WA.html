<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health results discussed. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the impacts kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the home. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health results is too minimal to identify the levels at which the listed effects might happen.<p>
