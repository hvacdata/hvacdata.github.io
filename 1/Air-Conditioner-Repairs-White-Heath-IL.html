If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from items or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems.
