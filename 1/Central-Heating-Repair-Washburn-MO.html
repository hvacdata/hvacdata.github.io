We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
