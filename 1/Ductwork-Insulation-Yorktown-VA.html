<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.

Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
