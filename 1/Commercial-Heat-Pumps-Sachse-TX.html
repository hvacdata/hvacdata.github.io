<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
