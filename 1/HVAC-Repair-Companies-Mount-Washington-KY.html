<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Mount Washington KY</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
