We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal.
