<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo tries to find more than just additional income or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can broaden Pueblo's client base or provide a new line of services. For instance, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out limited pipes work for choose clients. With this acquisition, Pueblo expanded its capabilities, making it possible for a boosted value proposition for a wider set of customers.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
