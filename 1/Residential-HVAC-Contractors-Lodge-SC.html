<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was very comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied terrific customer support at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance tasks we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>When you begin your search for an HVAC contractor in Columbus and surrounding residential areas, you most likely understand that not every HVAC contractor has the very same focus, skillset, or experience. 2 local HVAC companies might use two distinctly different set of services, so it's a great concept to research study HVAC contractors and examine their websites, evaluations and history before you call for service. By being familiar with more about an HVAC company before you call, you'll understand whether they are the very best company to deal with the service or issue you require them for.<p>
