<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces at the same time, but are not very energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.

<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
