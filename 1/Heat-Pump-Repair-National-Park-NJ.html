<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
