<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were valuable and helpful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service.

<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
