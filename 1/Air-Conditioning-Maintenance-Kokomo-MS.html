<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Kokomo MS?</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
