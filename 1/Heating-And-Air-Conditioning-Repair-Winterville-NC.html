<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally triggered by the absence of adequate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of impurities from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has carried out.

These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or just a high level of competition for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average incomes for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
