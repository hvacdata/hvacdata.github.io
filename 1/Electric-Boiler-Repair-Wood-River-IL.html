<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
