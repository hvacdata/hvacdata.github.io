<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The primary health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
