<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Talbotton Georgia</h3>
<p>If your ac system is more than eight years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's a basic issue like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up new machinery.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
