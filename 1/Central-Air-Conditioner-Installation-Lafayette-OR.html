In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
