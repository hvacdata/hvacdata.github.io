If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
