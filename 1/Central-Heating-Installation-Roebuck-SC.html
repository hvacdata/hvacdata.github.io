But in order to preserve a comfy indoor environment, you need every element of your cooling system to be working its best. So if your system requires a brand-new compressor, rely on our team for help. At Around the Clock Cooling & Heating, Inc., we provide reliable a/c compressor installation services for residential and commercial customers in Rye Brook, NY.<p>
<p>Because an a/c moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
