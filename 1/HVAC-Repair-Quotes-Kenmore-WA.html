The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation.
