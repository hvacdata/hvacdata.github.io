<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of.
