<p>Usually the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
