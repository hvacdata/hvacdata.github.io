<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
