<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Norton Massachusetts</h3>
<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, tobacco, coal, and wood items; building materials and furnishings as varied as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, damp or wet carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made from specific pressed wood items; items for home cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outside air contamination.<p>
<p>If you have a large home, a house with high ceilings, a home with many windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well encouraged to perform a house energy audit to assess where improvements may be made to increase the efficiency of an existing HVAC system. These modifications might in fact accumulate and potentially decrease your perceived requirement for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
