<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to decrease air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by just utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a qualified representative from a business or merchant to do the installation. If you pick to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed person to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee won't do you any great should the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the outset and hire a certified individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
