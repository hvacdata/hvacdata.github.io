<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; floor, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may cause countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, throat, and eye irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
