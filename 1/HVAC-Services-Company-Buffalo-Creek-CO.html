<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace since it's the most common heater in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>The use of air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable Energy section suggests that "Air Purification must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can work as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>As with homes, the most essential element affecting indoor air quality is the presence of toxin sources. Commonly found workplace pollutants and their sources. include ecological tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure materials; formaldehyde from pushed wood items; other organics from developing products, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and print shops; biological pollutants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>Warm weather condition is an indication that spring is well underway and that summertime, the hottest season of the year, will be here before you know it. It also indicates you will be cleaning off your air conditioning system and running it on an almost day-to-day basis.
