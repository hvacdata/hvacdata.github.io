<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

These contaminants choose your home furnishings, your woodwork, and even in your lungs. Plus, concerns like poor humidity can promote the development of mold, develop skin and hair concerns, and a host of other undesirable problems. Your indoor air quality is straight related to the total comfort and security you experience in your home, so ensuring that your air is healthy and safe is big deal. Luckily, our experienced air quality team can help you identify and correct any problems with your air quality, and set up high quality items to help you enjoy cleaner, safer air in your home.<p>
