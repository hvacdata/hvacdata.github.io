<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.

Hope this helps.<p>
