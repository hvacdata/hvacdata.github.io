<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
