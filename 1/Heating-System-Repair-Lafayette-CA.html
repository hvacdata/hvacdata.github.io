<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Lafayette CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

No matter what kind of a/c or heating unit you have, we can help you to conserve money, improve energy performance, and boost indoor air quality by upgrading and correctly keeping these systems.

You can be certain that all of our work is excellent and will surpass or satisfy building code requirements.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house lies, the local area's environment can change drastically. A house located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your house due to heat Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would require a much larger heating capability too which will impact costs. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by HEAPS.<p>
