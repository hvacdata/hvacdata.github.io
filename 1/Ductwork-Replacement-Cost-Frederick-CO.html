<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very humid environments or in cases where the a/c is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can require to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a couple of them are discussed here. First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using strong wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
