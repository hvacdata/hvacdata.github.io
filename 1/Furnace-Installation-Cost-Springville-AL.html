<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Springville AL - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air circulating, and avoids stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
