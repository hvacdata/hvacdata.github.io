<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax deductions offered for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>
