<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
