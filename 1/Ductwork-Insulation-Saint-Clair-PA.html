We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
