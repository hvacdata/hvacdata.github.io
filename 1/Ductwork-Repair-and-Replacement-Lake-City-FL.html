<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
