<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My wife said that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most good individuals I have actually fulfilled in a long time. We need to support the real people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>

Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
