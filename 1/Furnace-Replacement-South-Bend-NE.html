<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects throughout summertimes. The very best thing to do is making sure that the heater burners are inspected and cleaned thoroughly prior to colder seasons begin.

<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle homes.

Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple problem like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a worn fan belt.

Improving those elements might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing brand-new machinery.<p>
