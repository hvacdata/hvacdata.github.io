<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
