<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
