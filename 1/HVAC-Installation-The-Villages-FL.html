<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective.
