<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
