<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Deep Run NC</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on uncommon celebrations.<p>
