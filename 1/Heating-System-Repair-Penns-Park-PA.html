<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Penns Park PA</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PREPARES: Your HVAC system is an investment that pays for itself over the years, but only if you secure it to the best of your ability. Thankfully, this does not have to be a task! We take care of everything when you sign up for a Keefe's maintenance plan. No matter what make or model of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual inspections, marked down diagnostics, concern service, and fantastic offers on repairs and replacements.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
