Many common building products used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box beyond the house. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces at once, however are not very energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.
