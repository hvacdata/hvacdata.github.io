<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Avila Beach CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is improperly lined up or worn and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
