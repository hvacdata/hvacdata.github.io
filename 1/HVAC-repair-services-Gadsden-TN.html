<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the quantity of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. However, some makers require regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and understand.<p>
