<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Lexington KY</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
