In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
