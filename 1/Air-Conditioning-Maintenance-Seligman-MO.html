<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
