<h3>HVAC Repair in Greenbrier TN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on spending several thousand dollars for the total system.
