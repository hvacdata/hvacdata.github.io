<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems in Berwick LA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
