<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
