<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside the house's structure. This type of air conditioner also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged a/c unit, which is typically situated outdoors.

<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often tough to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
