<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be carried through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within your house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and understand.<p>
