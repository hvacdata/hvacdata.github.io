<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in Seymour</h2>

Insulation may be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
