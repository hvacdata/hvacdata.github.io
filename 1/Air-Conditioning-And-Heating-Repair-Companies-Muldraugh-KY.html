<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled.

Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
