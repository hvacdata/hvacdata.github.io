<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
