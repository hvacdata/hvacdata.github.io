<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Apex NC?</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Apex NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
