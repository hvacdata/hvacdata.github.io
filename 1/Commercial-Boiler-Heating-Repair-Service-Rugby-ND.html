<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar.

However many of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

<p>Numerous indoor air contaminants originate from the cooking area. Gas stoves release damaging pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide.
