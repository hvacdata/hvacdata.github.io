<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to evaluate structure ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas techniques used primarily in developing research study efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by building operators. NIST scientists are constantly establishing new test procedures, and after that showing them in the field to assess their expediency and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are shown in the field has resulted in the development of an important database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
