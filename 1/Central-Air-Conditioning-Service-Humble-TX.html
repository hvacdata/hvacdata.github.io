<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will need more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
