<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use.

Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
