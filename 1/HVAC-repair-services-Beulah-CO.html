The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

For instance, you might wish to work four hours each weekend and after that expand it to include a four more hours for three or four days during the week.
