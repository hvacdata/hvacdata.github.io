<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Reinholds PA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
