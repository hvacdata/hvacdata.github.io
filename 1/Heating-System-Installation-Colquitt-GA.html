<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Colquitt GA</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological impurities are wet or wet structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are animals and home plants.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
