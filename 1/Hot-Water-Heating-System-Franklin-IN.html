<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
