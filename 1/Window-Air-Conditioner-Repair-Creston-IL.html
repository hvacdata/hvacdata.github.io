<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company introduced a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health hazard reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have actually learned how to determine the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
