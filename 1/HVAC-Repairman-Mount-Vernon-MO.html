Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
