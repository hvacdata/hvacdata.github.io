<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
