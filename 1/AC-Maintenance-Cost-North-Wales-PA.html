<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with many windows or a house with inadequate insulation, heating your floorings rather than the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.

<p>Air toxins can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air toxin arising from gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile flooring heating unit prematurely, prior to the mortar has treated, can trigger the grout to crack or to not adhere correctly, and might void the service warranty of your mortar item.
