<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
