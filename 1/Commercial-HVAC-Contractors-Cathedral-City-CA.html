<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
