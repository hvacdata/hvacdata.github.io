<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Lots of people ignore the degree of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is normally pictured as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints utilized in the home. To intensify the issue, it is approximated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and more than half that time is invested in the home.<p>
<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the higher temperatures in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside is connected with a higher prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
