<p>This in flooring heating unit consists of one thin continuous cable television heating element woven into a mat that you set up under the tile. These heated floors are a project best done when changing the floor or revamping covering of an existing space or when adding a new room. Heated floor covering can be installed as extra heat to take the chill out of the flooring or as area heat to warm the entire restroom. Heated flooring is also a great project for warming entryway and kitchen area floors.<p>
<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly solidify and cure-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
