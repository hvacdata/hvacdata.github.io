<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
