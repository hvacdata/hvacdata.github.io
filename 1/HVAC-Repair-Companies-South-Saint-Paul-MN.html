<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
