The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the a/c unit: Do not put it in an egress window that serves as the only means of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
