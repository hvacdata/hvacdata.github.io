<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside.<p>
