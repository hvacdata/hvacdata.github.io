<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

When examining your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, always make sure.

<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Hallsboro NC</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
