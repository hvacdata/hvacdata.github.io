Indoor air contamination studies have recognized a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for efficiency. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>
