<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, since the system is integrated.
