He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
