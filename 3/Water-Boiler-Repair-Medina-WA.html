<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
