<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
