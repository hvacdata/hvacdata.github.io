<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. Many house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
