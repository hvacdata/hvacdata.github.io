Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; flooring, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
