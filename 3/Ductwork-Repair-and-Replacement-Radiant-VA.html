<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Radiant VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that add to indoor air contamination. Such factors include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide emitted by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
