<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow constraint will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
