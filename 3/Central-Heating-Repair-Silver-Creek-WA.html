<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Silver Creek WA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to supply threshold notifies. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your monitoring devices to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the situation right away.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
