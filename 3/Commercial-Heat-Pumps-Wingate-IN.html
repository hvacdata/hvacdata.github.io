This is usually used in a third-floor or second location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the specialists thought they just didn't seem best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
