<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to minimize expenses (especially at night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the stores vary beyond an appropriate range that might prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
