<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
