<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
