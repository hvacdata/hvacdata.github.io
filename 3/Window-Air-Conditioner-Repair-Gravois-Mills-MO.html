<p>There are 2 primary kinds of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating service. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system, think about possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system properly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system is in use, open a door from the space where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
