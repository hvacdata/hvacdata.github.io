<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Lynchburg VA?</h3>
<p>For entire home setups, it's challenging, if almost impossible, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be utilized in one or numerous spaces like restrooms, kitchens or utility room are easily renovated with electric radiant floor heat. This is much more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home may be suitable for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Lynchburg VA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
