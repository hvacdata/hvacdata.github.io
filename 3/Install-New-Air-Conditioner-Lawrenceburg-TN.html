<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
