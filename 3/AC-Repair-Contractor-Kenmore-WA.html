<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to buy it. My wife said that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have met in a long period of time.
