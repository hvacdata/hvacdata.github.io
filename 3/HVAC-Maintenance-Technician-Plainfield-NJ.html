<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as traditional forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new building.

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop required depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your house and is important iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads.
