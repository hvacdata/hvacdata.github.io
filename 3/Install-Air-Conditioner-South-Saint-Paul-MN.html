<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can require to select products that will avoid indoor air problems from occurring - a number of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient moisture barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being damp.<p>
