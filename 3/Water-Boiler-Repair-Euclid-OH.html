<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days.

<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in covert or hardly ever accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, opportunities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
