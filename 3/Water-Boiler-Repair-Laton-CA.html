<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however numerous use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
