Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
