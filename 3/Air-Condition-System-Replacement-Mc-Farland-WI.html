<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and individuals, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
