Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
