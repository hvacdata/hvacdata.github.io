But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
