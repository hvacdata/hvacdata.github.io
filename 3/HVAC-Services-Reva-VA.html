<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
