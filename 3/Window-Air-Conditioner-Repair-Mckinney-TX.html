<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a conventional forced air heating system. Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heating systems, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of approximately 30% of their output. Required air heater also tend to create cold and hot spots throughout your home, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been used frequently in a variety of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have prohibited a number of asbestos items. Makers have also voluntarily restricted uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently found in older houses, in pipeline and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other finishing materials, and flooring tiles.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do disappoint up until many years after exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some developed illness from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task sites.<p>
