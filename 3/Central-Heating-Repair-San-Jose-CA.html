<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built.

When radon becomes trapped in concentrations and structures develop inside your home, exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>
