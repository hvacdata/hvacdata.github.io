<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, homes and schools matters, particularly since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
