<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
