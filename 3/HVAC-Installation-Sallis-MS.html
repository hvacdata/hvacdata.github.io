<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
