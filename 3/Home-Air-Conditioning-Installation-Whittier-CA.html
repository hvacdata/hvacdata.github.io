<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Whittier CA</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and very experienced. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was obviously reasonable.<p>
<p>First make sure the air filter is clean and in excellent condition if you see a decline in heat output. Next, inspect other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dust, dirt and particles, an affordable fix that can assist boost efficiency. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and located properly. Try moving it far from direct sunshine given that this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your home. If this occurs, your thermostat will shut down the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold. You might also need to examine your insulation to ensure that warm air does not get away from your area through numerous openings.<p>

As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2.
