<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Bedford Hills NY</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
