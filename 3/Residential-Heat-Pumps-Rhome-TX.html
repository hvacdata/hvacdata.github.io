<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 usually.
