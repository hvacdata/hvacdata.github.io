<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
