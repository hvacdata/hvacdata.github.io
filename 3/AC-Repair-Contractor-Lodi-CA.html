<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a effective and straightforward approach to decrease ambient air contamination and potential health threats, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you may look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
