<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>There is so much info readily available on the various kinds of radiant flooring heat systems-- a lot of options to pick from, so many products available and so numerous reasons why to utilize a glowing floor heating system.

<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main hazard of mold growth, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to set off episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing disease.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize contaminants, we advise installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to get rid of the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems also help manage germs and organic odors. Most store-bought filters can not get rid of these smallest of allergens and don't eliminate germs and gases.<p>
