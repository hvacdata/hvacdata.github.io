<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Union WA</h3>

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>

Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
