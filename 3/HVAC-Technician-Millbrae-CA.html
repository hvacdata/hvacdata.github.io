<p>Because a task such as this is going to require a rather extensive amount of work it is advised that a homeowner demand a number of estimates from a variety of contractors. The best times of the year to do such a task are in the months in which houses are not utilizing their heating unit. This will normally permit the work to be completed quickly and the property owner to get the best rates available. It is also crucial to make sure that a contractor will go over the tax benefits of an upgrade to an effective heating unit, and even aid with paperwork and documentation.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
