<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
