<p>My oldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didn√¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. We√¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didn√¢ $ t really consider anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is it√¢ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
