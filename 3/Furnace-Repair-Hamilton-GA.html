<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health impacts discussed.

<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air.

Considering larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
