<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>When I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working, integrity Energy was quick to react. They showed up the next day and changed two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heating systems can heat your home. Honestly, our home heater is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
