<p>. Prior to picking the installation place of air conditioner, numerous main aspects need to be thought about. First of all, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor systems should not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Secondly, there must not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that may avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outside system must also be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively released outside and the efficiency of the entire system will drop dramatically. It is extremely a good idea to set up the air conditioner units in easily accessible locations, for additional maintenance during operation.<p>
