<p>Immediate effects might appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
