<h3>Best Heat Pump in Prairie Village Kansas</h3>
<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are great that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's finest to change the capacitor.<p>

<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it does not, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
