<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
