<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
