<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>For instance, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing toxins into the environment.
