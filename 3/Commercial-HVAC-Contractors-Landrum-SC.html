<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
