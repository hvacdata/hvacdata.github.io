<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
