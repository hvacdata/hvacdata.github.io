<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit.

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system.
