<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare celebrations.<p>
