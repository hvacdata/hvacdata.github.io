Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations.
