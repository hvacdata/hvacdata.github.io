<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, because it is protected inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>We understand that pipes and HVAC emergencies take place at the most bothersome times. That's why we offer emergency services 24 hr a day, 7 days a week.
