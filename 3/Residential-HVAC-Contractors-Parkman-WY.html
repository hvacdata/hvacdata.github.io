<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
