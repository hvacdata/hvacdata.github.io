<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
