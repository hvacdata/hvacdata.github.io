<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any air flow constraint will lower the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and filthy. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make certain the system is working efficiently, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
