<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual areas.<p>
