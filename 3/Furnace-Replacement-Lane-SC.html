Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
