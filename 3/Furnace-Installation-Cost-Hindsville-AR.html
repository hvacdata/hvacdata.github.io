<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>Similar to a lot of house improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary extensively based on the size of the house.

A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>

I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
