<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
