<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
