<p>Homeowners might likewise assume that since a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth.

Perhaps Realtors must think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any provided asking cost. That said, homebuyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
