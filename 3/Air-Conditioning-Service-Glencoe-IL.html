<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
