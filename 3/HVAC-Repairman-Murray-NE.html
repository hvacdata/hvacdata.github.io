<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
