<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
