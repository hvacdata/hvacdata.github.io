<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
