<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your house might not have adequate ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty.

But more intricate issues-- recognized by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 tactics listed below might be appropriate.<p>
