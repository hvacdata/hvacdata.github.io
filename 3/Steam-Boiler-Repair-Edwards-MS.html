Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months.

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested.

The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
