<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
