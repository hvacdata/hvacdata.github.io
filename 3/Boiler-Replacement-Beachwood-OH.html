<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capabilities.

For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or extremely hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
