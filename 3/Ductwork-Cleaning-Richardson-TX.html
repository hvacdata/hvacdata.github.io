<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
