<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
