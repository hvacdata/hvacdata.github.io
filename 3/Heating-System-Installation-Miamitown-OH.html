<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your home that perfect temperature throughout the year.

Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
