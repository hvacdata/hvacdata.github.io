<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
