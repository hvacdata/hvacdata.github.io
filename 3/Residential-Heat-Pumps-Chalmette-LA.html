POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are provided back in the type of heat.<p>
