<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
