<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
