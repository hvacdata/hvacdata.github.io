<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
