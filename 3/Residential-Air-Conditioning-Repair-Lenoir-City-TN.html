<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
