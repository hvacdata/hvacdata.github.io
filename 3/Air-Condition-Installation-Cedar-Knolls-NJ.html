<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Cedar Knolls NJ</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
