<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
