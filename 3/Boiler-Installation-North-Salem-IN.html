<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
