<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is usually utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour.
