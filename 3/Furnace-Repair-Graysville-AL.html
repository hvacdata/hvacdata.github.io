<h3>Air Condition Company in Graysville Alabama</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>A lot of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications during Preventative Maintenance check outs, independently, as an include on service for you. No 2 systems are exactly the same, but filter modifications are something we provide during PM check outs if the customer needs it- especially the unattainable filters- due to the fact that we know how essential it is that they be altered out & how hard it can be for a resident to do it.<p>
<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan starts. If  it doesn't, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
