<p>New air conditioners typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking implies higher energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs. A good SEER rating for you depends on your home size, where you live and other factors.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
