<p>New air conditioners typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER ranking implies higher energy efficiency and possibly lower energy costs. A good SEER rating for you depends on your home size, where you live and other factors.

<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with lots of windows or a house with insufficient insulation, heating your floors rather than the air might not be enough to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed. House owners would be well advised to carry out a house energy audit to assess where enhancements might be made to increase the performance of an existing HVAC system. These modifications could really accumulate and potentially decrease your perceived need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
