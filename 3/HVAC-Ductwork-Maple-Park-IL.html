<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any brand-new heating system in a home, it is required to re lower the energy and evaluate load of the house. A more energy efficient home will not just minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, but it will significantly improve the convenience of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we arrange a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements usually include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend several competent home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for referrals.<p>
