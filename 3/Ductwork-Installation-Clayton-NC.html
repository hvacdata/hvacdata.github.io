<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Clayton NC</h3>
<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
