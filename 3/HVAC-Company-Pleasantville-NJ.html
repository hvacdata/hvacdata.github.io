<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
