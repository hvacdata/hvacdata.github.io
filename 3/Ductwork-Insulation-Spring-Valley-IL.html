<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect.
