<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning unit are performance-tested to get rid of unusual or harsh road and weather conditions. Numerous basic units break down after simply 4 hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate offers long lasting strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, therefore, sound too.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Heating is likewise among the biggest energy customers in your house, so homeowners who may be shopping for a new furnace must thinking about changing it with a newer, more energy-efficient model to conserve cash and help the environment.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
