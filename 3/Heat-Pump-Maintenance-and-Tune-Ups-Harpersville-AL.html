<p>A health survey ought to be established and distributed to all worried workers.

<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Building Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
