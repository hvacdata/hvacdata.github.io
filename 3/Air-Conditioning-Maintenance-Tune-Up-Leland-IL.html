<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is trustworthy and truly cared about us and our scenario. We came home one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came over that very same night. Although he didn't have actually the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>
