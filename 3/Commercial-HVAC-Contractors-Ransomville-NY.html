Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling residents. Unlike other types of a/c, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air should be allowed to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and preserve.<p>
