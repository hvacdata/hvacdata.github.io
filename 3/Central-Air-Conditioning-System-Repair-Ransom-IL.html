<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
