<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
