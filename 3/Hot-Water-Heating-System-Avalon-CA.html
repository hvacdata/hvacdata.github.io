<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
