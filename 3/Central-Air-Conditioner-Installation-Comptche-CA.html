<p>There are two main types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
