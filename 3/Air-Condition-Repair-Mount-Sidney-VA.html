<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on).

The female crimp adapters ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
