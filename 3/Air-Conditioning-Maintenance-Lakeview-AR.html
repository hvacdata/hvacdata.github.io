<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.
