<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
