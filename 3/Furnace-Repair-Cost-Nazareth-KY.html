<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
