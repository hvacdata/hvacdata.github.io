<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
