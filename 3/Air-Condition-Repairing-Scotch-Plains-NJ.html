<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic utilized worldwide, including EMV. He's said a number of times that the unique code feature is numerous and optional, lots of retailers do not utilize it since it slows down transactions a lot more due to the back-and-forth interactions required.
