<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
