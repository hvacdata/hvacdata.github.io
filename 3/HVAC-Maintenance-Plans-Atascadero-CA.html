<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Atascadero CA</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in over half the office indoor air examinations it has actually conducted. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be real. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is very important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which generally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
