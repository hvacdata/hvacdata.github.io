<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them up until they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
