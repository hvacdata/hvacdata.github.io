Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
