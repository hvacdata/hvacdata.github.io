<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same.
