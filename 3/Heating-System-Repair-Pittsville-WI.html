<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
