<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
