<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can typically be performed in just a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
