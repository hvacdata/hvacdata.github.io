<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
