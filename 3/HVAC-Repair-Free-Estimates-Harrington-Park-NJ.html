<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
