<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite substantial.<p>
