<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
