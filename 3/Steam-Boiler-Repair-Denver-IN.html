Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide, radon, unpredictable organic substances ), particulates, microbial impurities (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stressor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and using ventilation to water down contaminants are the primary techniques for enhancing indoor air quality in most buildings. Residential systems can further enhance indoor air quality by routine cleaning of carpets and area rugs.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
