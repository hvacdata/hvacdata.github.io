<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
