<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Highlands TX</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
