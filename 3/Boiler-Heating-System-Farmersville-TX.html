<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
