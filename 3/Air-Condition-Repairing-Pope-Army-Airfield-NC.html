<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Pope Army Airfield North Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heatpump is among the most energy effective approaches of heating or cooling a home.

In the summertime, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature remains consistent no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer consistent and reliable cooling and heating.<p>
