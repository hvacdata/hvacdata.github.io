Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how often your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll have to clean them.

The EPA research study prescribed and controlled techniques utilized on a smaller number of homes.

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
