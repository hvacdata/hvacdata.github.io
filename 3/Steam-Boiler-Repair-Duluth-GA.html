<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality products and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating & cooling items all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a standard split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of a number of rooms with one external system. In the outdoor system of this air conditioning unit there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the space.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed combustible or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
