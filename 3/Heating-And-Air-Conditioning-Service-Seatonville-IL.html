<p>We're spending a lot more time indoors, nowadays. While lots of people assume pollution is simply an outdoor issue, your house (and workplace) can also be contaminated. As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not think sufficient about exposure to all the things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. , if it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
