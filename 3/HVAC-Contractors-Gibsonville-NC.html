<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, said Pueblo looks for more than just extra earnings or scale when it makes acquisitions - it searches for companies that can expand Pueblo's customer base or offer a new line of services. For instance, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo performed limited pipes work for select customers.

<p>I extremely advise using this service. Very trustworthy extremely good. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty quickly and efficient and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
