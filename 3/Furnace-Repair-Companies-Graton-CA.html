<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Setting up cooling costs between $3,350 and $5,912 with the majority of property owners reporting spending $4,631 typically. This cost is normal of setting up a brand-new AC unit to your forced air furnace. Other choices include single window units or portable systems for $234 to $700 or ductless mini splits for $660 to $4,500. Your total cost depends on the type and size of air conditioning system you require.<p>
<p>If your single phase ac system isn't old sufficient to validate replacement, think about a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
