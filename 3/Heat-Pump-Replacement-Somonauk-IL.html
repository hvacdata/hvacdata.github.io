<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>
