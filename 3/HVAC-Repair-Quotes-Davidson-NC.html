<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention.
