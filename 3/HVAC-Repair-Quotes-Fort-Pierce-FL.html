<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
