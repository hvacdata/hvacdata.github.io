<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely specify the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously supplied in your buildings, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
