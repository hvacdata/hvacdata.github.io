<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Braselton GA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
