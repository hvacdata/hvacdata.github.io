<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
