<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
