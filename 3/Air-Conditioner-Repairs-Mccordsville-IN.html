<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path.

However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
