<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
