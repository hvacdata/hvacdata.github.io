<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
