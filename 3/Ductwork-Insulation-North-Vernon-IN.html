According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins.

High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside is connected with a higher prevalence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to rise and flow out high structure openings to the outside (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, but care should be taken to guarantee comfort. In warm or humid climates, preserving thermal comfort solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>
