<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
