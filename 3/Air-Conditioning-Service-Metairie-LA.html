To ensure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation price quote to figure out the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we don't simply change it with the very same size unit you presently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Generally, SEER provides more data based on how the EER carries out in various temps. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
