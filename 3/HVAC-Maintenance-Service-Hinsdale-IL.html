<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize.
