<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working.
