<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
