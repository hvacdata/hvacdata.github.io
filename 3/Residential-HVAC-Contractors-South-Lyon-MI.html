<p>Remember that the SEER score is calculated using the exact same set of temperatures throughout the board. The typical summertime temperature level to come to the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to arrive at the right SEER rating for your area, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>We recommend using our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the quantity of services provided. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the service warranty.<p>
