<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
