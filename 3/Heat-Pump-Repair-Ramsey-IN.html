<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
