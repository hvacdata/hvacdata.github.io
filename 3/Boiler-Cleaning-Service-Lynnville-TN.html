<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>At Bob's Heating & Air Conditioning, we believe in constant education and training at our really own Bob's University. To guarantee our installers and specialists are at the forefront of HVAC innovation and security, we need weekly training meetings and bi-weekly security conferences.
