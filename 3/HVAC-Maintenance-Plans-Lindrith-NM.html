<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
