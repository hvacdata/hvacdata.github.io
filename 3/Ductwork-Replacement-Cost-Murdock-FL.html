As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.

If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
