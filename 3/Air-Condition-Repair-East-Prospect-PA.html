<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in East Prospect PA</h3>

<p>Due to the fact that an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both should be kept tidy.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
