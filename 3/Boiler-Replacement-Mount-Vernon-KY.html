Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, since it is protected inside. When it does require to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
