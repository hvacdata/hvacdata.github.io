<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
