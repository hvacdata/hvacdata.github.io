<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Most furnaces have several control panel. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
