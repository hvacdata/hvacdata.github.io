<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental danger to the health of children in the United States."

When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead goes into the body.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
