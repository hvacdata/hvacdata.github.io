<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
