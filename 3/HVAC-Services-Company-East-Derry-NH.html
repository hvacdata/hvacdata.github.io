<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat offers warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and understand the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
