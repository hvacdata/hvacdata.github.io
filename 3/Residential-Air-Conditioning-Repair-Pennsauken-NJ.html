Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
