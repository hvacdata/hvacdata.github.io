<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can affect an individual's capability, health, and comfort to work.

<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in wet air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and filthy. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
