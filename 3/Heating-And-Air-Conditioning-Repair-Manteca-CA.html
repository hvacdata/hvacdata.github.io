<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
