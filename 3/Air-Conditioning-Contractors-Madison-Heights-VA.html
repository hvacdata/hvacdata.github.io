<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
