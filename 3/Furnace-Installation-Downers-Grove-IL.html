Producers normally continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard enters into effect.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and infants are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Kids might have greater exposures considering that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
