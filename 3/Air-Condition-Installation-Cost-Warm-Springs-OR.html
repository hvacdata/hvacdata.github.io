<p>Oil heating systems are generally not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than lots of heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the design you acquire.
