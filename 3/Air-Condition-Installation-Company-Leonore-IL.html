<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
