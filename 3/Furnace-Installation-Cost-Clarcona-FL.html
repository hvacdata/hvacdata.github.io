The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working successfully, consider having a regular coolant system flush.

Evaluation of this data may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
