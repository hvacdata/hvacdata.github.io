<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heater, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
