<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be residing in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues.
