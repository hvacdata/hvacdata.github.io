<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely thorough in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer service at the end of the appointment by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t correctly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
