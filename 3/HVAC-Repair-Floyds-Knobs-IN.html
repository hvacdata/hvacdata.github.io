<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Choosing the ideal size central air system for your home is extremely essential, as is choosing either a bundle system, which keeps condenser, fan and coil all in one system, or a split system, which positions the condenser outside the fan and the house and coil inside.
