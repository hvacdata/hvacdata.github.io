<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
