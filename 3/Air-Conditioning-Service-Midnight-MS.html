<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, because it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution.

Indications that can indicate your house may not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To find odors in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise referred to as air-to-air heat exchangers). To find out more about air-to-air heat exchangers, get in touch with the Preservation and Renewable Resource Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
