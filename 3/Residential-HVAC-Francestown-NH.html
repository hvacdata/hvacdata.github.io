<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Hiring Francestown NH HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Many people understand that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air contamination can likewise have substantial, damaging result. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of toxins may be two to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
