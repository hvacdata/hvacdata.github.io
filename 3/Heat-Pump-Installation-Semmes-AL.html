<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
