<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
