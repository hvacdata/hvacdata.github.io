<h3>A Look At Ductwork At Earlville IL Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No additional charge.<p>
