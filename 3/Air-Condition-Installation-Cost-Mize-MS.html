ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination results look excellent for braising and plumbing quality.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation.
