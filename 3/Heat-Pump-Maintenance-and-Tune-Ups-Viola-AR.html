<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
