<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. There are a number of style approaches in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar concepts.

These different heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.
