<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
