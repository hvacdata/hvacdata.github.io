<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE firms tend to operate with the objective of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or even a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, previously this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>Just a professional can precisely identify why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems weird or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the procedure does not work, something else is wrong and you require a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it often, it's most likely time for a professional opinion.<p>
