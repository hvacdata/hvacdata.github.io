<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
