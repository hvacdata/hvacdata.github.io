<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Sedalia NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
