<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
