<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned routinely, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, replacing a furnace and examining filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health symptoms is an effective, properly created and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system figures out the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is contributed to the office atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its toxins are either exhausted to the outside or re-circulated throughout the building.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>
