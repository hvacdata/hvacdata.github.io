<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to evaluate structure ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These treatments vary from advanced tracer gas methods used mainly in building research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be utilized by building operators.

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
