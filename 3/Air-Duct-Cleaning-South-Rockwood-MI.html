<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used frequently in a range of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.

<h3>Central Heating System in South Rockwood MI</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working once again. He is honest, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
