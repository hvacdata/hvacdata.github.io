<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
