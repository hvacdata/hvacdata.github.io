<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
