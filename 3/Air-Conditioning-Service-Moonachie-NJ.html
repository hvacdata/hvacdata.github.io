<p>Expert heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the price of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>

<p>Although installation is simple and does not require much time, trying this job is not an excellent idea.

Furthermore, HVAC systems have guarantees that need competent technicians to perform installation. You could void the service warranties by taking on that task.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
