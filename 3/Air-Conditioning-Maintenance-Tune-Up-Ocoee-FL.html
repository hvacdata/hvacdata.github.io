<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those aiming to conserve money on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
