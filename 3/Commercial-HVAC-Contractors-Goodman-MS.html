Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
