<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Knowing the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Mantua OH</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected pollutants (scaling in tough water locations). The systems need to be checked a minimum of twice per year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be washed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
