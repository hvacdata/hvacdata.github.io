<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can often be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
