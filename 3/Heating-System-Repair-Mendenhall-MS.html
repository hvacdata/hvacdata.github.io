<p>Many people undervalue the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is normally envisioned as the black smoke given off from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, paints, and cleaners used in the home. To compound the problem, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and more than half that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
