<p>Consumer items which contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause signs associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas.

Use items that contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside only if the area is well aerated.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your medical professional about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great building management.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been revealed to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no proof, however, that a sensible number of houseplants eliminate substantial amounts of pollutants in offices and houses. Because extremely damp soil might promote the growth of bacteria which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants should not be over-watered.<p>
