It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
