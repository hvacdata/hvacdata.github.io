<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
