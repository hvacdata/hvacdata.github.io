<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation.

<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are responsible for lots of damaging impacts, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are required to produce particular health problems.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
