<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
