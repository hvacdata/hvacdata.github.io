<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning system increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
