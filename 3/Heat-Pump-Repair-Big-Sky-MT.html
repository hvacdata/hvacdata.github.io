<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>I had a dreadful experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. In addition, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with your home.

During the inspection on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health threat factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new property owner I have found out how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
