<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
