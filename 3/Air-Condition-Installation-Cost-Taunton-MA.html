<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved issues. I would advise this product to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time.
