<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
