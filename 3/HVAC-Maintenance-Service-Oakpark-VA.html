<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
