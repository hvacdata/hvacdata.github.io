<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
