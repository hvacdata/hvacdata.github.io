<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
