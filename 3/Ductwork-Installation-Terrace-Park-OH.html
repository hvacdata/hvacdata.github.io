<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is unclean, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at maximum performance and might get too hot. This makes they HVAC system work harder, developing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also cause your energy expenses to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your home. It will have to work more difficult and may overheat if the system is too small. Usually, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot house.<p>
