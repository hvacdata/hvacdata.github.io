<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
