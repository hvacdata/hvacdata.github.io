<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should likewise be required to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)
