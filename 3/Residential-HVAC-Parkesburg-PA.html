<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
