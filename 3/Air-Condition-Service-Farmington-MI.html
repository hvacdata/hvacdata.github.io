The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I highly suggest using this service. Extremely reliable very great. Took care of a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

I am presently on the maintance plan. He looks after it two times a year with out having to be advised to do it.<p>
