<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
