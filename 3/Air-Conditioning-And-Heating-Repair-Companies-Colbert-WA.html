Trustworthy on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. However then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

These aspects include bad ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature level, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering the building.
