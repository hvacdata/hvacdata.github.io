<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>

Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is unblocked and dry.<p>
