<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>

But more complicated issues-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods below may be suitable.<p>
