<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a really common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance because the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than numerous heat pump options, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you buy. Among the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating options. This means it can heat up your home to the desired temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Most modern warm water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (rather than older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air using radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
