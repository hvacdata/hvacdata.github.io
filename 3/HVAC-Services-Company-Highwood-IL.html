<p>One of the main reasons a furnace will run constantly is because something is dirty or clogged Before attempting to fix any problem, require time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Check the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven.
