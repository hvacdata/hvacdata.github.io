<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips for Your Home in Thayer MO</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install evaluation results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
