<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
