<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn supplied great customer service at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we may want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation likewise depends on the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system.
