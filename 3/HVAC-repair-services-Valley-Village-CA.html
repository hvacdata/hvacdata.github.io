<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
