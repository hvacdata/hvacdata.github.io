<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>3.
