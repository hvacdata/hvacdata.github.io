<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., office equipment; wall, floor and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
