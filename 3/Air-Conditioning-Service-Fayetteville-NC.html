<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
