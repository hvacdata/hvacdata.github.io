Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for a/c. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone. Just like measuring the size of an unit needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your house also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<h3>Methods To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Hufsmith TX</h3>
