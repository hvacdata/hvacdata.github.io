<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
