<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
