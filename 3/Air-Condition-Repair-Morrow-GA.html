<p>A geothermal heating system is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy.

<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
