<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
