<h3>Tips To Avoid Furnace Repairing Costs in Mauckport IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
