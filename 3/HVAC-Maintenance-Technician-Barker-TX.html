<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
