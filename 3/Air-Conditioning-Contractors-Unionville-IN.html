<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
