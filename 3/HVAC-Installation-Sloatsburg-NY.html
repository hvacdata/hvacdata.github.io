<p>Immediate impacts might appear after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant effects are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
