<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in.

Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
