<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Changed to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have actually dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies for many years and Wachoff's is certainly the very best I have actually had the chance to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being blocked with debris that can limit airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down totally. By contrast, changing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in just a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
