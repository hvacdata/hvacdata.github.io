<h2>How To Hire HVAC Services in Collinsville</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations develop inside your home, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
