<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
