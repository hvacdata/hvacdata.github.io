<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional hot water heater.

If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is most likely that it is supported by the plumbing. Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>
