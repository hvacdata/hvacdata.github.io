<p>Typically the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
