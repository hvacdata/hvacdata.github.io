<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Shenandoah VA</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartments bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually enjoyed the single-family home installation business totally turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
