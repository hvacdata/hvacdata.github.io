<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
