<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
