<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
