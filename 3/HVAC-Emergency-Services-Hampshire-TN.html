<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>
