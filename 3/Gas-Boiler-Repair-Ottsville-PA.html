<p>We look at hints before we supply guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher every year, we understand the unit is not running effectively.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
