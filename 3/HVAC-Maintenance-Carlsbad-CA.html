Radiant heat systems don't distribute air at all, which in fact enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your exposure to high levels of airborne contaminants.<p>

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Carlsbad CA?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the concern and fixed really rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might bring on an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergies, but not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Just a specialist can accurately identify why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems odd or you lose self-confidence, it's time to call a professional. Similarly, if the process doesn't work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to take a look at the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it regularly, it's most likely time for an expert opinion.<p>
