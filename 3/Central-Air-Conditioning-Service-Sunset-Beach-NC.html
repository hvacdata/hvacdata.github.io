<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
