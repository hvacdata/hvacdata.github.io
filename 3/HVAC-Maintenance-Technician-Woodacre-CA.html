<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space. The larger the area, the more powerful the home heater needs to be. For currently built home heater, the contractor will need to remove the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
