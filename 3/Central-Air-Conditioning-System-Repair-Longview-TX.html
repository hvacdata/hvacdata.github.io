<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
