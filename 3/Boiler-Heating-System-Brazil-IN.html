<p>The fact is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - or perhaps worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American costs 87% of their life inside your home, you 'd believe that indoor air quality would be something we 'd become aware of more frequently. But do not stress!

An air conditioning system also decreases indoor pollen count - another plus for allergic reaction -patients.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to rise and flow out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, however care needs to be taken to ensure comfort. In humid or warm environments, maintaining thermal comfort exclusively via natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
