<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
