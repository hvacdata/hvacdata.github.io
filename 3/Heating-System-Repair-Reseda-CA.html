People might complain of one or more of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; tiredness or lethargy; headache; lightheadedness; queasiness; irritability and lapse of memory.

We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We want we had known him then.<p>
