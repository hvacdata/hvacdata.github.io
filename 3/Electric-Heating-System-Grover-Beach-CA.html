"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
