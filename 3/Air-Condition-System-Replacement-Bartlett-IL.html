<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

<p>Heating systems resemble automobiles. As they age, you can replace one part only require another part changed or repaired next year.

Another repair indication is whether you needed to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below zero night.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
