<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Location the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is likely that it is supported by the plumbing if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>

<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Lake Isabella CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
