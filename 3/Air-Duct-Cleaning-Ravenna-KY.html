<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
