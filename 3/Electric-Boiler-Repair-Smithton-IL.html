<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Photo 6).<p>
