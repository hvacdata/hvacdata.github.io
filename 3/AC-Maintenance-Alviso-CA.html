<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very handy in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
