<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, babies, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
