<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
