Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
