<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Five Points CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Five Points CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
