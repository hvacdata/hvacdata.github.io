<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Five Points CA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Five Points CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.
