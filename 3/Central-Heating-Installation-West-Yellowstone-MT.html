<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
