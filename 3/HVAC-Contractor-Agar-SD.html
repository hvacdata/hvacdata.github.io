<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically develop in ductwork, limiting airflow. Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear really complicated initially, needing specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge. When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not have to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heater) with the same amount of electrical energy. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
