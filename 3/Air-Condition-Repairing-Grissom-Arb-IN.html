<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
