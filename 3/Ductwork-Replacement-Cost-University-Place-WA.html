<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in University Place Washington</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold.

Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
