<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
