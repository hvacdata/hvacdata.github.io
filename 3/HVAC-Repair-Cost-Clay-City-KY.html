<h3>HVAC Air Conditioning Service in Clay City KY</h3>
<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the problem area in looking over the bill. He fixed the problem in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the 9 years we have used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>Many AC units feature a number of unique functions that can even more improve efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, homeowners might wish to search for one that features an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy costs even more. Obviously, more features suggest greater central air costs.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
