Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.
