<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance  in Revere Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Hazardous exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
