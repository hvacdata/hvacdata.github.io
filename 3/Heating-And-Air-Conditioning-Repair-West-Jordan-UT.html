<h3>Recognizing the Importance of HVAC Systems at West Jordan UT</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
