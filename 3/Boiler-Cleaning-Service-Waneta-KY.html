<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better option.
