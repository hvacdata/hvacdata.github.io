<p>Though it may be tough to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not just filthy up the air, but result in other health issues.

<p>Typically the most reliable way to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions.
