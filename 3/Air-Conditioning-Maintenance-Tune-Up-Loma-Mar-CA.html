<h3>AC Maintenance in Loma Mar California</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
