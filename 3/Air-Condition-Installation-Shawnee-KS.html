<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold development and ought to be discarded. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
