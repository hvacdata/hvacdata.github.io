<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning unit and fridges used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
