<p>Your Evaluation This is my 3rd time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself available - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these devices). I have absolutely nothing but excellent things to say - he has taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick response - quick resolution.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
