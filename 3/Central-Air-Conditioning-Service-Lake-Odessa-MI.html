<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the required assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
