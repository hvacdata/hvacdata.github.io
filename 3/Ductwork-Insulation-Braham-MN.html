<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
