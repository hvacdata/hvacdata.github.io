<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other kinds of a/c, evaporative coolers count on the outside air to be funnelled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to comprehend and maintain.<p>
