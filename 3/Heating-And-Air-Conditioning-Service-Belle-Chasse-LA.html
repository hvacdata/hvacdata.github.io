<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
