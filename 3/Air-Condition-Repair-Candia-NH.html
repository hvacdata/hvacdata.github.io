Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
