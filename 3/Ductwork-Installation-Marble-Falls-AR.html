<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
