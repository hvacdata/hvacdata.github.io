<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>

You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area.
