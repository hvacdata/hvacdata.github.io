<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Ocean View New Jersey</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
