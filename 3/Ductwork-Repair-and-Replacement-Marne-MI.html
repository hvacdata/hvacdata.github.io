<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
