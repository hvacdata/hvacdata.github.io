<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
