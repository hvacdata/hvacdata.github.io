<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
