<p>Radiant heat provides a number of special benefits over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not need to fret about duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through strong things will also trigger it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home heated by a radiant system will warm up faster, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the numerous benefits that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
