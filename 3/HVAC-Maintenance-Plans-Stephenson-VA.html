<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
