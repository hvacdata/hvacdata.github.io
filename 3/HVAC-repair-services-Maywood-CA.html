<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
