<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
