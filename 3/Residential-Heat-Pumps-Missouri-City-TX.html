<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Missouri City TX?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
