<p>To set up a safe assessment or appointment with an HVAC technician throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your location in an online search. Message or call technicians to ask whether they can carry out a consultation over the phone or perhaps over a video call. This way, they can examine the problem without increasing the risk of virus transmission by visiting your house.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do determine an especially energy-efficient in-floor heater and select to install it in your home, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses.
