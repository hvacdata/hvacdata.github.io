<p>If your a/c is more than eight years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the cost, unless it's an easy issue like particles clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
