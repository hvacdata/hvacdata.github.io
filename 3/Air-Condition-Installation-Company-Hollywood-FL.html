Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements however it does provide standards about the most typical IAQ workplace problems.<p>
<p>EPA's Total Direct exposure Evaluation Approach (TEAM) research studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical organic toxins to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outdoors, despite whether the houses were located in extremely commercial or rural areas. Extra TEAM research studies indicate that while individuals are using items consisting of natural chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to very high contaminant levels, and raised concentrations can persist in the air long after the activity is finished.<p>
