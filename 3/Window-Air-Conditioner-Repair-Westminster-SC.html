<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers impact your comfort, they can also cause duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT an excellent concept. You won't save any additional money and will end up causing more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
