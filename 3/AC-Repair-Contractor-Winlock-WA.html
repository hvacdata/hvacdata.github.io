<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
