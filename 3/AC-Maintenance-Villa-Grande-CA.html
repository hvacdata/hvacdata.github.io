Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
