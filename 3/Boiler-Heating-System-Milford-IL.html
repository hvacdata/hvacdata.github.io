<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and replaced frequently. The cooling and heating will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will worsen. Checking and altering the air filters is among the most crucial elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
