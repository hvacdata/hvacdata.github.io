<p>Measurement treatments are being developed and shown to examine building ventilation and indoor contaminant concentrations. These procedures range from sophisticated tracer gas methods used predominantly in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by building operators. NIST scientists are constantly developing new test procedures, and after that showing them in the field to examine their feasibility and dependability. The efforts in which these procedures are demonstrated in the field has led to the development of an essential database of building ventilation and indoor air quality efficiency.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
