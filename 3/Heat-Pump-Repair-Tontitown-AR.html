<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to provide threshold signals. If, for example, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the situation instantly.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
