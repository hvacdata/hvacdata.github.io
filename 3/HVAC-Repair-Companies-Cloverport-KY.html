<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. However many of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c fails, begin by checking any fuses or breaker. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
