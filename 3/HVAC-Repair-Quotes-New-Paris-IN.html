<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of 30 days throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees.

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
