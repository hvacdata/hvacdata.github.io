<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
