<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
