<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
