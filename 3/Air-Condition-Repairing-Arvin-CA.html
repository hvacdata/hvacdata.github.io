<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema.

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the space, the more powerful the house heater needs to be.

<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
