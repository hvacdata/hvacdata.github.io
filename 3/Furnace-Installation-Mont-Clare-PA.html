<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Mont Clare PA?</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
