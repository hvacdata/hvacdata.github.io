<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
