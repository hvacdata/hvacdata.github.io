Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate systems have actually been integrated in the four years given that or are currently under building and construction. The large majority of these units are mixed-use or multi-family, where a/c is more of a market standard, says Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move up until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>Because it can help your system last longer, preserving your air conditioner is crucial. In reality, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates homeowners might make their unit between 5 and 15 percent more effective simply through routine filter replacements!
