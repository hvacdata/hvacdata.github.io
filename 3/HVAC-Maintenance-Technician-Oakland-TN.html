<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
