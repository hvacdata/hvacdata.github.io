<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methodologies. The CMHC study called on several duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they belonged to a research study, and the scientists did not manage for time spent or methods utilized. The EPA study prescribed and managed techniques used on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have defects, no other research study has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and techniques utilized by duct-cleaning companies have changed since these studies were carried out, the air ducts in houses have not.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can produce a lot of water since they eliminate moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
