<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
