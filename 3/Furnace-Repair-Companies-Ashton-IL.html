<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
