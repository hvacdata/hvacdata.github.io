<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
