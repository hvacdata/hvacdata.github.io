<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
