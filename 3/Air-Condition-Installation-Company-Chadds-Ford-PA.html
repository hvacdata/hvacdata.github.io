<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Chadds Ford PA</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
