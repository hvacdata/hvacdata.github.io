<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
