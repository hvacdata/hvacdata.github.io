<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>
