<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>Radiant heat uses a number of special advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems.
