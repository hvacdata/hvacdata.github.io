<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Unionville PA?</h3>
<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
