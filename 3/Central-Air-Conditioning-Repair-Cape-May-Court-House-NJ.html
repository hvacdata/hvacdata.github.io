<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Cape May Court House NJ?</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's products and services was impressive. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Service in Cape May Court House NJ</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
