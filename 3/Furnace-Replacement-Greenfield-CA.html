When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper.

When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy.
