<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Radiant heat provides a number of distinct advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems. They don't have to stress over duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heater types. Transferring heat through solid objects will also cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house heated up by a radiant system will warm up much faster, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
