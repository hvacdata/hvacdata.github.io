<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Cabin John MD</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
