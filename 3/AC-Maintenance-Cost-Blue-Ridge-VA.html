They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My wife stated that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have actually satisfied in a long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.
