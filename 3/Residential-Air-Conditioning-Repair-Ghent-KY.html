<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.
