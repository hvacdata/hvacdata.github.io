<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
