<p>Devices expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your house heating system. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but lead to greater energy costs. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long run. Rates for gas heaters range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency models up to $12,500 for high-efficiency designs.

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
