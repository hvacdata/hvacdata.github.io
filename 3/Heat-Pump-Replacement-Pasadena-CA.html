In damp or warm environments, keeping thermal comfort exclusively through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups.

<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of a/c unit, numerous primary aspects need to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there ought to not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that may prevent it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside system must also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outdoors and the performance of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is highly a good idea to set up the air conditioning system systems in quickly accessible locations, for more maintenance during operation.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
