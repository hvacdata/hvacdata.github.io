<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Gheens LA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be properly vented and cleaned from the furnace routinely.

Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
