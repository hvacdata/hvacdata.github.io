We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
