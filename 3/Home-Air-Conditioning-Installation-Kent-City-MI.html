On those days when you just can't seem to warm up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem due to the fact that they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, since they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to distribute hot air, in-floor heating systems can decrease the quantity of dust and seasonal irritants in your home.<p>
