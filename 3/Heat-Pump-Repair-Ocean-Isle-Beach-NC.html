<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>House owners might also assume that because a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their home's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely impacts residential or commercial property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Possibly Realtors should think about a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heat system might add to, or deduct from, any given asking rate. That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
