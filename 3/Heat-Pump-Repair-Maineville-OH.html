If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
