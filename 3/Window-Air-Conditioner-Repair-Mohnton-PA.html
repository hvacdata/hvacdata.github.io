<p>These guys have been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a home might cost.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC in Mohnton PA</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
