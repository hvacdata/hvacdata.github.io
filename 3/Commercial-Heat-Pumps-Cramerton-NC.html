<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
