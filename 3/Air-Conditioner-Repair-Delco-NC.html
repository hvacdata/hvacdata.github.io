<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
