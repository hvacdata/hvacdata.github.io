<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure occupancy.
