<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can impact an individual's capability, health, and convenience to work. It can include temperature level, humidity, absence of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards however it does provide standards about the most common IAQ work environment problems.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is enabled to increase and flow out high structure openings to the outside (stack impact ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use really little energy, however care should be taken to ensure convenience. In warm or humid environments, keeping thermal convenience solely through natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and disperse cool outdoor air when suitable.<p>
