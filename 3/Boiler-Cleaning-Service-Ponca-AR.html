<p>Many people are aware that outdoor air pollution can impact their health, but indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging impact. EPA studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of toxins may be two to 5 times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
