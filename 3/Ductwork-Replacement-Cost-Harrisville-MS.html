<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Heating Service in Harrisville MS</h3>

<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or skills necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might become stopped up, lowering air circulation volume, circulation, and quality. They also may become locations for molds and germs to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly maintained to avoid germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to decrease levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable variety of houseplants get rid of substantial quantities of contaminants in offices and homes. Indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered due to the fact that excessively damp soil might promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic people.<p>
