<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, particularly in an older home. Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may require special licenses, and there is limited flexibility in case of changed heating requirements. Throughout usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
