As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being clogged up, reducing air circulation distribution, volume, and quality.

Micro-organisms or bacteria might also exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
