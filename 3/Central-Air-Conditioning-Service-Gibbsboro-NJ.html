<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are expert and always on-time.

<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your home still heats up to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to call in an expert to repair the system and check.<p>

<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a simple problem like particles blocking the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing devices, but also the ducts that deliver the cool air and the general quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects might increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
<p>People have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint since these activities generate large amounts of lead dust.
