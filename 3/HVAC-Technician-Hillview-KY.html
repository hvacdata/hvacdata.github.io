I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers depend on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be allowed to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to preserve and understand.<p>
