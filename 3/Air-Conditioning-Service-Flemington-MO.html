<p>When company is less chaotic, it can be the best time to conceptualize creative methods for promoting your HVAC company too. For example, you might attempt taking part in house and garden shows, trade convention or other kinds of event marketing.

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
