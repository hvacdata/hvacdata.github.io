<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
