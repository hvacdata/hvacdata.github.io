Radiant heating, for example, may be a better fit for your requirements.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
