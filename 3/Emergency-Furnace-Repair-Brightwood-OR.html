<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC.
