<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores circulating through your house. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your surroundings.<p>

<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
