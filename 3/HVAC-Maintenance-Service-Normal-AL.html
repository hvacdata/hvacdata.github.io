<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was type of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair at Normal AL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>We look at ideas before we supply suggestions to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
