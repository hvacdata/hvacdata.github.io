Rather, the combustion is optimized by determining the exhaust gasses and making clinical adjustments. This alone could spend for the entire maintenance see at today's cost of natural gas.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
