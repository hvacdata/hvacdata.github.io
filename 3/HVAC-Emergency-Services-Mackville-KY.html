<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Mackville KY</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
