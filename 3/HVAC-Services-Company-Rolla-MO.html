<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life expectancy, replacement might be the most affordable option.<p>
