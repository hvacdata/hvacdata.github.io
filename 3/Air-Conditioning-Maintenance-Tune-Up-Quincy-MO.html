<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Quincy MO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
