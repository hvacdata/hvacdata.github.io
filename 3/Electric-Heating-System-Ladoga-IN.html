<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
