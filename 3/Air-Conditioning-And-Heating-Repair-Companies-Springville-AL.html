<h3>AC Maintenance in Springville AL</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
