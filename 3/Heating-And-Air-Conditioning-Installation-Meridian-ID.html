<p>The world's leading all-in-one software for commercial and residential HVAC services. HVAC service technicians are subject to a number of possibly dangerous conditions. Technicians are often needed to operate in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to unfavorable weather condition for extended periods of time.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
