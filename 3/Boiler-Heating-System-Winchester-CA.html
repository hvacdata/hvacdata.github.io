<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not only unclean up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
