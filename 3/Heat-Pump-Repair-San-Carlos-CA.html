<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
