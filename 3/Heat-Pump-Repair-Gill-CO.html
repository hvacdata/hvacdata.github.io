<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue.

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Gill CO?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future.
