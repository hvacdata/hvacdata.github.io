<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could grovel twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Lacey Spring VA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
