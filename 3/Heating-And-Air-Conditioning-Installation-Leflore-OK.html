<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.)
