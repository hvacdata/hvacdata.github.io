<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Mcclellan CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is honest, trustworthy, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
