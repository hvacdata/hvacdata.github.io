Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.
