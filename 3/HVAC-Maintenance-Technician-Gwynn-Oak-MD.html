<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time.

I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
