<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
