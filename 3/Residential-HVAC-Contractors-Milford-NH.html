<h3>Check Out Ductwork In Milford NH Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
