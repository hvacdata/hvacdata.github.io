<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's a little-known truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically build up in ductwork, limiting air flow.

A filthy filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
