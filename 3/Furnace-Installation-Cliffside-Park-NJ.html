<h3>Residential HVAC in Cliffside Park NJ</h3>
<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Oil furnaces are normally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%. A few high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
