<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line?

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
