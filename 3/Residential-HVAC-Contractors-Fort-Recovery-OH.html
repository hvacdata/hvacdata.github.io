<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Fort Recovery OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
