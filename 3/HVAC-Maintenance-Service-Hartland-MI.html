<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
